		<English>Welcome to the Crusades scenario! 
		
		If this is your first time playing, remember that the map is based on a medieval Mappa Mundi, and as such, it is not a very accurate representation of Earth. If you find it confusing, keep in mind that in many medieval maps, the North was on the left side, not up!
		
		The British Isles: a tangled web of old rivalries, with a measure of outside threats as well. Scotland, Eire, England, Gwynedd - whoever you choose, you will have enough knives pointed at your back. Due to the fact that Mappa Mundi this scenario is based upon was made in England, this is the most detailed and upscaled region of the map. A fun self-imposed challenge for the Irish player is to try retracing the voyage of St. Brendan and find the Garden of Eden (yes, it is possible if you have carracks and are sufficiently determined!)</English>

		Scandinavia and Rus: Scandinavian kingdoms are in a rare position that basically allows them to freely choose their own targets. They are relatively large, and their natural isolation ensures that there are no immediate threats to them. Kievan Rus is experiencing its historical golden age at the start, and if it manages to eliminate the immediate threats (first of all the Cumans), it has a good shot at winning.</English>

		The Iberian Peninsula: Reconquista is just starting. The kingdoms of Castille, Leon, Galicia and Aragon (represented by a single civ) and soon-to-be-kingdom of Portugal have a clear goal ahead of them: reclaim Iberia. Conversely, as Almoravids you will start very powerful, but you'll have to deal with invading armies of various Christian entities. A fun self-imposed challenge when playing Spain is to colonize America by the end of the scenario.</English>

Keep in mind that you will likely need to bring down both Byzantines and France to feel safe. A good idea would be reining in the popes as soon as possible.</English>

		Byzantine Empire: due to the efforts of Alexios Komnenos, the empire has somewhat recovered from a disastrous defeat from Seljuks in 1071. Not a lot of ground has been regained since, but the Empire is now in a good shape to start reclaiming what has been lost. You start with excellent territory and are #1 in score, so basically all you have to do to win is keep this up.

They are relatively large, and their natural isolation ensures that there are no immediate threats to them. Kievan Rus is experiencing its historical golden age at the start, and if it manages to eliminate the immediate threats (first of all the Cumans), it has a good shot at winning.</English>

		Far east: Mongols dominate this region. While China is currently split in two, whichever side you choose your most significant problem will still be the Mongol hordes. Japan is living through one of the calmer periods in its history, and its geographic location protects it from Mongol invasion better than other civs in the area. The Mongols should be treated more as a force of nature than as a regular civ; try to use them to your advantage, preying on civs they hit, grabbing a city or two. Due to starting close to Mongols, civs in this area are among the hardest to play.</English>

		Sweden: Thirty Years War has left you with a large and modern army, and some possessions around the Baltic. Could this be a jumpstart to forming Swedish Empire that will dominate the region? Remember that your starting territories are rather poor (even if Sweden proper is well-developed), and your initial advantage will start to fade if you don't move quickly.</English>
