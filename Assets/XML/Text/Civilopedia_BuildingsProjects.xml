		<English>[TAB] A missile silo is an underground vertical cylindrical container for the storage and launching of ICBMs. They typically have the missile some distance under the surface, protected by a large "blast door" on top. Until the 1960s ICBMs had been launched from surface bases. The Soviet Union used completely aboveground launchers similar to those found at a spaceport, which made them vulnerable to US bomber attack. The missile silo was first suggested in the 1950s in the United Kingdom as a suitable housing for Blue Streak missiles. Only one test missile silo was built in the UK at RAF Spadeadam and with the cancellation of the Blue Streak project in 1960 the UK ICBM nuclear missile capability was transferred to submarines. However the idea of the underground rocket bunker was adopted by the USA. The US Atlas missile used four basing schemes. The first were vertical, above ground launchers at Vandenberg AFB, CA. The second was stored horizontally in a warehouse- / shed- like structure with a retractable roof at War AFB, WY. The third was somewhat better protected, stored horizontally in a concrete building known as "coffins", then raised to the vertical shortly before launch. These rather poorly protected systems were a side effect of the cryogenic liquid fuels used, which required the missiles to stand empty and then be fueled immediately prior to launch. The fourth version of the Atlas ICBM (the Atlas F) were stored vertically in underground silos. The Atlas was fueled in the silo and then had to be raised to the surface for launch. It could not be launched from within the silo. The Titan I missile used a similar silo basing scheme to the Atlas F. Things changed with the introduction of the US Titan missile and the Soviet UR-100 missile series. Both used new liquid fuels that could be stored in the missiles, thereby allowing for rapid launch. Both systems were then moved to the silo system. The introduction of solid fuel systems in the later 1960s made this even easier. The silo has remained the primary basing system r land based missiles since that time. However, the increased accuracy of inertial guidance systems has since rendered them somewhat less protected than they were in the 1960s. The US spent considerable effort in the 1970s and 1980s designing a replacement, but none of the complex systems were ever produced. The US, the USSR, and China all developed mobile ICBMs as well, but only the Soviet Union and China put them into production. * MPS (Mobile Protective Shelters) plan, in which 200 MX missiles would be shuttled around between 4600 soft shelters. * Midgetman missile * one version of the Topol-M * Dong Feng-31 (CSS-9): Chinese road mobile ICBM (China also two older mobile IRBMs) Today much of the US arsenal has been placed on submarines (as SLBMs), while Russia has downsized their own force to a handful of mobile and silo-based weapons. China also has silo-based weapons, but is now concentrating development on expanding its submarine and road mobile weapon capability. The increase in decommissioned missile silos has led governments to sell them to individuals, who then convert them to indisputably unique abodes. -(Wikipedia)</English>
		<German>Unter einem Raketensilo versteht man eine unterirdisch gelagerte Abschussvorrichtung f&#252;r einen interkontinentalen ballistischen Flugk&#246;rper. Dieser sollte im Szenario eines konventionellen Krieges bei drohender Niederlage der eigenen konventionellen Streitkr&#228;fte abgefeuert werden, um in erster Linie die gegnerischen atomaren Abschussvorrichtungen zu zerst&#246;ren und somit deren atomares Angriffspotenzial gegen das eigene Territorium abschw&#228;chen. Den Gegensatz dazu bildeten mobile Abschussrampen (u.a. SS-20 auf sowjetischer und Pershing 1 u. 2 auf amerikanischer Seite)- Waffensysteme vorrangig gegen Streitkr&#228;fte, die in erster Linie bei einem Krieg an der Front eingesetzt worden w&#228;ren.
In der Zeit des Kalten Krieges gab es in der Sowjetunion sowie im gesamten Gebiet der Vereinigten Staaten genauso wie in Gro&#223;britannien und Frankreich Raketensilos, die dazu bestimmt waren, diese Funktion zu erf&#252;llen. Tr&#228;gersysteme waren unter anderem die sowjetische SS-18 "Satan" (NATO-Codewort) und die amerikanische "Peacekeeper" (MX) Rakete; daneben gab es britische und franz&#246;sische Eigenentwicklungen.
In der Regel ging man davon aus, dass ein bis zwei atomare Sprengk&#246;pfe mit einer Sprengkraft von mindestens 50 Kilotonnen ausreichen, um eine Abschussvorrichtung in einem Raketensilo auszuschalten.
Die unterirdische Bauweise diente vorrangig dem passiven Selbstschutz vor Bombardements und Sabotage sowie der sicheren Lagerung des sehr empfindlichen Flugk&#246;rpers, weniger dagegen der Tarnung vor gegnerischen Aufkl&#228;rungsma&#223;nahmen. In den Zeiten des Kalten Krieges waren beinahe alle unterirdischen Abschussvorrichtungen der jeweils anderen Seite bekannt und galten im Falle eines atomaren Schlagabtauschs neben den Industriezentren und Gebieten mit gro&#223;er Bev&#246;lkerungsdichte als vorrangiges Angriffsziel.
Mit dem Fall des Eisernen Vorhangs verloren Raketensilos mehr und mehr an Bedeutung. Heutzutage gibt es in den USA sogar einige Silos, die zu &#246;ffentlichen Museen umgewandelt wurden.</German>

His voyage aboard the H.M.S. Beagle was instrumental not only in the establishment of his theory, but also in the application of the scientific method to the study of nature. Darwin published his theory of evolution in his book "On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection". His studies were so thorough that the scientific world never challenged his findings. However, his findings were, and continue to be, challenged on philosophical and religious grounds. Darwin's research opened many new lines of inquiry, and inspired a wave of new biological research. -Civ3</English>

		<English>[TAB]Uraniborg was an astronomical observatory and alchemy laboratory established and operated by the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe. It was the first custom-built observatory in modern Europe, and the last to be built without a telescope as its primary instrument. Uraniborg's construction was a unique phenomenon because it occurred at an interesting point in history. It not only was one of the last observatories built before the development of the telescope, but it was one of the first observatories to be completely funded by a government entity for the purpose of research. Uraniborg was an extremely expensive project and it is estimated that it cost about 1% of the entire state budget during construction. Uraniborg was built c.1576 - c.1580 on Ven, an island in the Øresund between Zealand and Scania, Sweden, which was part of Denmark at the time. It was expanded with the underground facility Stjerneborg (Swedish: Stjärneborg) on an adjacent site.
[TAB]Brahe also innovated and invented many precision instruments which he used to carry out his studies in the observatory. Research was done in the fields of astronomy, alchemy, and meteorology by Tycho and his assistants. Uraniborg was a place for the study of astronomy, meteorology, astrology, and alchemy. Over the lifespan of Uraniborg it had upwards of thirty different assistants for Tycho Brahe, and visits from many other researchers and royalty; Martin Zeiler, Nicolaus Reimers, Erik Lange, and David Wunderer being some of the noted visitors. 
[TAB]During the period in which Uraniborg was actively used, astronomy and astrology were thought to be linked to the other scientific fields, and as such the observatory was used to discover more than the astral bodies. Brahe's driving force for research at Uraniborg was the desire to make astrology an empirical science and rid it of "mistakes and superstition." Brahe and his many assistants began charting the positions of stars, planets, and other celestial bodies over time with unprecedented accuracy in this pursuit. At its best, Brahe's data was accurate up to a minute of arc, an improvement of ten times compared to what was previously available.
[TAB]The observatory was not just the home of scientists, but it also supported the artisans who constructed the tools that the scientists needed. Tycho Brahe was an innovative astronomer of his time. Within the Uraniborg observatory, he utilized innovative observing methods and built new instruments to improve the accuracy of his readings. Brahe's goal to gather accurate data on the cosmos influenced the creation of a wide range of contraptions to prove his theories on the celestial positions and a geo-heliocentric (Tychonic) model of the Solar System, a theory that the Earth is the center of the Sun and Moon while the Sun is also the center of the other planets. After Tycho's death, Johannes Kepler used the observations of Tycho himself to demonstrate that the orbits of the planets are ellipses and not circles, creating the modified Copernican system that ultimately displaced both the Tychonic and Ptolemaic systems.

		<English>[TAB]The Art of War is an ancient Chinese military treatise dating from the late Spring and Autumn period (roughly 5th century BC). The work, which is attributed to the ancient Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu ("Master Sun"), is composed of 13 chapters. Each one is devoted to a different set of skills or art related to warfare and how it applies to military strategy and tactics. For almost 1,500 years, it was the lead text in an anthology that was formalized as the Seven Military Classics by Emperor Shenzong of Song in 1080. The Art of War remains the most influential strategy text in East Asian warfare, has influenced both East Asian and Western military theory and thinking, and has found a variety of applications in myriad competitive non-military endeavors across the modern world including espionage, culture, politics, business, and sports. 
		[TAB]The book contains a detailed explanation and analysis of the 5th-century BC Chinese military, from weapons, environmental conditions, and strategy to rank and discipline. Sun also stressed the importance of intelligence operatives and espionage to the war effort. Considered one of history's finest military tacticians and analysts, his teachings and strategies formed the basis of advanced military training throughout the world. (Wikipedia)

Dar&#252;ber hinaus betonte Sun Tzu auch die Wichtigkeit des Geheimdienstes und der Spionaget&#228;tigkeit im Krieg.
Der chinesische Milit&#228;rstratege galt lange Zeit als einer der besten Taktiker und Analytiker der Welt, so dass seine Lehren und Strategien bedeutenden Einfluss auf viele nachfolgende Generationen hatten und als Grundlage f&#252;r die moderne Milit&#228;rausbildung dienten.

		<English>[TAB] Petronius is a deepwater compliant tower oil platform built from 1997 to 2000 and operated by Chevron in the Gulf of Mexico, 210 km southeast of New Orleans, United States.
[TAB] A compliant piled tower design, it is 640 metres (2,100 ft) high to the tip of flare boom from the mudline (sea floor) and was arguably the tallest free-standing structure in the world, until surpassed by the Burj Khalifa in 2010. This claim is disputed since only 75 metres of the platform are above water and it's unknown if the structure could have supported itself if built on land as it is partially supported by buoyancy. The multi-deck topsides are 64 metres by 43 metres by 18.3 metres high and hold 21 well slots. The compliant tower weighs around 43,000 tons with the topside weighing in at an additional 7,500 tons Around 9,600 m3 (60,000 barrels) of oil and 3,000,000 m3 (100 million cubic feet) of natural gas are extracted daily by the platform.
[TAB] The platform is situated to exploit the Petronius field, discovered in 1995 in Viosca Knoll (block VK 786) and named after Petronius, the Roman writer. The seabed is 535 m (1,754 ft) below the platform. The compliant tower design is more flexible than conventional land structures to cope better with sea forces. It can deflect (sway) in excess of 2% of height. Most buildings are kept to within 0.5% of height in order to have occupants not feel uneasy during periods of movement.</English>

Das Gewicht der Plattform betr&#228;gt 52.552 Tonnen. Sie ist selbstfahrend und wird durch 6 computergesteuerte Rolls Royce-Turbinen angetrieben, welche um 360 Grad schwenkbar sind. Durch ihre leistungsstarken Turbinen und mit Hilfe von GPS kann sich die Eirik Raude direkt &#252;ber einem Bohrloch positionieren und diese Position exakt halten. Da der Wellengang permanent stattfindet, sendet das GPS die exakte Position zur Bohrung an den Bordcomputer, der dann die Turbinen steuert und die Eirik Raude bei jedem Wellengang in der optimalen Position zur Bohrung h&#228;lt. GPS alleine reicht jedoch nicht aus, da nicht-milit&#228;risches GPS eine Abweichung von bis zu 10 Metern zul&#228;sst. Aus diesem Grund errechnet die Eirik Raude selbstst&#228;ndig mit eigenen Messungen in Bezug auf den Meeresboden ihre Position und korrigiert sie gegebenenfalls.

The market handles more than 400 different types of seafood from tiny sardines to 300kg tuna, from cheap seaweed to the most expensive caviar. Overall, more than 700,000 metric tons of seafood are handled every year at the three seafood markets in Tokyo, with a total value in excess of 600 billion yen (approximately 6 billion US dollars). Tsukiji alone handles over 2000 metric tons of seafood per day.
The first market in Tokyo was established by Tokugawa Ieyasu during the Edo period to provide food for Edo castle (nowadays Tokyo). Tokugawa Ieyasu invited fishermen from Tsukudajima, Osaka to Edo in order to provide fish for the castle. Fish not bought by the castle was sold near the Nihonbashi bridge, at a market called uogashi (literally, "fish quay") which was one of many specialized wholesale markets that lined the canals of Edo (as Tokyo was known until the 1870s).(Wikipedia)

Im Jahr 2003 wurden vom zentralen Gro&#223;markt 615.409 Tonnen (2.246 Tonnen t&#228;glich) Fisch und Meeresfr&#252;chte umgesetzt. Rund 90% des vorgenannten Handelsvolumen entfiel hierbei auf den Tsukiji-Fischmarkt.
Die geschichtlichen Wurzeln des Fischmarktes reichen bis ins 16. Jahrhundert zur&#252;ck, als der Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu Fischer aus Osaka nach Edo brachte, um seinen Hof mit Fisch zu versorgen. Er gab ihnen auch die Erlaubnis, den nicht an den Hof gelieferten Fisch in der N&#228;he der Nihonbashi-Br&#252;cke zu verkaufen. Parallel entwickelte sich auch der Handel mit Gem&#252;se und Fr&#252;chten. Der Markt wurde 1923 durch das gro&#223;e Kanto-Erdbeben stark zerst&#246;rt, wurde allerdings in Nihonbashi wieder aufgebaut. Erst im Jahre 1935 erfolgte der Umzug nach Tsukiji. Im Jahre 2012 wird der Markt - einem Beschluss der Pr&#228;fektur Tokio folgend - nach Toyosu im Stadbezirk Koto verlegt. (Wikipedia)

		<English>[TAB]Johannes Gensfleisch zur Laden zum Gutenberg (born. circa 1398, presumed to have died February 3, 1468 Mainz) was a German metal-worker and inventor who achieved fame for his contributions to the technology of printing during 1448, including a type metal alloy and oil-based inks, a mould for casting type accurately, and a new kind of printing press based on presses used in wine-making. Tradition credits him with inventing movable type in Europe -- an improvement on the block printing already in use there. By combining these elements into a production system, he allowed for the rapid printing of written materials, and an information explosion in Renaissance Europe.
Gutenberg was born in the German city of Mainz, as the son of a merchant named Friele Gensfleisch zur Laden, who adopted the surname "zum Gutenberg" after the name of the neighborhood where the family had moved. (Wikipedia)

Gutenbergs eigentlicher Verdienst war die Entwicklung von Lettern, an denen die Farbe haften blieb und die leicht und schnell herzustellen waren, sowie die praktische Umsetzung des ganzen Druckvorgangs. Obwohl das seine Leistung nicht im geringsten schm&#228;lert, trifft die Bezeichnung "Erfinder des Buchdrucks" deshalb nur bedingt zu.
&#220;ber Gutenbergs Leben und also auch &#252;ber sein Wirken ist wenig bekannt, das meiste bleibt Spekulation. Sein Bruder Friele Gensfleisch lebte von 1434 bis zu seinem Tode 1447 in Eltville, wo er vermutlich mit Gutenberg eine kleine Druckerei gr&#252;ndete. (Wikipedia)

[PARAGRAPH:2]The village of Chak Chak, also known as Pir-e Sabz, consists of a shrine perched beneath a towering cliff face in the desert of central Iran. It is the most sacred of the Zoroastrian mountain shrines. Located near the city of Ardakan in Yazd province, Chak Chak serves as a pilgrimage point for pious Zoroastrians. Each year from June 14-18 many thousands of Zoroastrians from Iran, India and other countries flock to the fire temple of Pir-e Sabz. Tradition has it that pilgrims are to stop the moment they see the sight of the temple and continue their journey on foot the rest of the way.[PARAGRAPH:3] Meaning _drop-drop_ in Persian, Chak Chak is where Nikbanou, second daughter of the last pre-Islamic Persian ruler, the Sassanian Emperor Yazdegerd III of Persia, was cornered by the invading Arab army in 640 CE. Fearing capture Nikbanou prayed to Ahura Mazda to protect her from her enemies. In response to Nikbanou's pleadings, the mountain miraculously opened up and sheltered her from the invaders.[PARAGRAPH:4] Notable features of Chak Chak include the ever dripping spring located at the mountain. Legend has it that these drops are tears of grief that the mountain sheds in remembrance of Nikbanou. Growing beside the holy spring is an immense and ancient tree said to be Nikbanou's cane. Legend also has it that a petrified colorful cloth from Nikbanou was also visible in the rocks although pilgrims have since taken this.[PARAGRAPH:5]The actual temple of Chak Chak is a man-made grotto sheltered by two large bronze doors. The shrine enclosure is floored with marble and its walls are darkened by fires kept eternally burning in the sanctuary. In the cliffs below the shrine are several roofed pavilions constructed to accommodate pilgrims.</English>

		<English> The Arc de Triomphe (Arc de Triomphe de l'&#201;toile) is one of the most famous monuments in Paris. It stands in the centre of the Place Charles de Gaulle (originally named Place de l'&#201;toile), at the western end of the Champs-&#201;lys&#233;es. There is a smaller arch, the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel, which stands west of the Louvre. The Arc de Triomphe (in English: "Triumphal Arch") honours those who fought and died for France in the French Revolutionary and the Napoleonic Wars, with the names of all French victories and generals inscribed on its inner and outer surfaces. Beneath its vault lies the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier from World War I.
The Arc de Triomphe is the linchpin of the historic axis (Axe historique) - a sequence of monuments and grand thoroughfares on a route which goes from the courtyard of the Louvre, to the Grande Arche de la D&#233;fense. The monument was designed by Jean Chalgrin in 1806, and its iconographic program pitted heroically nude French youths against bearded Germanic warriors in chain mail. It set the tone for public monuments, with triumphant patriotic messages.
The monument stands 50 metres (164 ft) in height, 45 m (148 ft) wide and 22 m (72 ft) deep. The large vault is 29.19 m (95.8 ft) high and 14.62 m (48.0 ft) wide. The small vault is 18.68 m (61.3 ft) high and 8.44 m (27.7 ft) wide. It is the second largest triumphal arch in existence (after Arch of Triumph in Pyongyang). Its design was inspired by the Roman Arch of Titus. The Arc de Triomphe is so colossal that three weeks after the Paris victory parade in 1919, (marking the end of hostilities in World War I), Charles Godefroy flew his Nieuport biplane through it, with the event captured on newsreel.[TAB]</English>

These pyramids relied on intricate carved stone in order to create a stair-stepped design. Many of these structures featured a top platform upon which a smaller dedicatory building was constructed, associated with a particular Maya deity.

		<English>[TAB] The religion of the Vedic civilization is the root of classical and modern Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. Its liturgy is reflected in the text of the Vedas. The religion centered on a clergy (the Brahmins) administering sacrificial rites. A small fraction of conservative Shrautins continue this tradition in modern Hinduism.
Texts considered to date to the Vedic period, composed in Vedic Sanskrit, are mainly the four Vedas, but the Brahmanas, and some of the older Upanishads are also considered Vedic. The Vedas record the liturgy connected with the rituals and sacrifices performed by the purohitas. To the rishis, the hymns of the Rigveda and other Vedic hymns were divinely revealed, and they were considered "hearers" (shruti means "what is heard"), rather than "authors".
The mode of worship was performance of sacrifices and chanting of hymns (see Vedic chant). The priests helped the common man in performing rituals. People prayed for abundance of children, cattle and wealth. This mode of worship is largely intact even today, as is evident in numerous Hindu rituals, which involve recitations from the Vedas for prosperity, wealth and general well-being.
Elements of Vedic religion reach back into Proto-Indo-Iranian times. The Vedic period is held to have ended around 500 BC, Vedic religion gradually metamorphosizing into the historical Dharmic religions, notably the Vedanta schools and Buddhism, which evolved into contemporary Hinduism. Hinduism spans surviving conservative traditions (see Srauta), as well as fundamentally reformed ones (see also Puranas).</English>

		<English>[TAB] Carthaginian religion was based on Phoenician religion. Phoenician religion was inspired by the powers and processes of nature. Many of the gods they worshipped, however, were localized and are now known only under their local names. The supreme divine couple was that of Tanit and Ba'al Hammon. The goddess Astarte seems to have been popular in early times. At the height of its cosmopolitan era, Carthage seems to have hosted a large array of divinities from the neighbouring civilizations of Greece, Egypt and the Etruscan city-states.Cippi and stelae of limestone are characteristic monuments of Punic art and religion, and are found throughout the western Phoenician world in unbroken continuity, both historically and geographically. Most of them were set up over urns containing cremated human remains, placed within open-air sanctuaries. Such sanctuaries constitute striking relics of Punic civilisation.</English>

		<English> The Celtiberians (or Celt-Iberians) were a Celtic people living in the Iberian Peninsula, chiefly in what is now north central Spain and northern Portugal, before and during the Roman Empire. The group originated when Celts migrated from what is now France and integrated with the local Iberian people. A sign that the two populations intermingled can be detected in the presence of Celtic elements among the names of Celtiberian nobility.
The Celtiberian language is attested from the first century BC. Other, possibly Celtic languages, Lusitanian, were also spoken in pre-Roman Iberia. The Lusitanii gave their name to Lusitania, the Roman province name covering current Portugal and Extremadura. Extant tribal names include the Arevaci, Belli, Titti, and Lusones.[TAB]</English>

Ob sie aus einer Vermischung zwischen Kelten und Iberern hervorgegangen sind, im Wesentlichen eine der beiden Gruppen darstellen oder sie eine lange eigenst&#228;ndige Vorgeschichte haben, ist unklar.
Arch&#228;ologische Funde brachten &#252;berwiegend metallische Gegenst&#228;nde hervor, wie Pferdegeschirr und Waffen. Die gefundenen Schwerter sollen Vorbild f&#252;r das r&#246;mische Gladius gewesen sein.

		<English> The Statue of Zeus at Olympia is one of the classical Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. It was carved by the famed Classical sculptor Phidias (5th century BC) circa 435 BC in Olympia, Greece.
The seated statue occupied the whole width of the aisle of the temple that was built to house it, and was 40 feet (12 meters) tall. "It seems that if Zeus were to stand up," the geographer Strabo noted early in the 1st century BC, "he would unroof the temple." Zeus was a chryselephantine sculpture, made of ivory and accented with gold plating. In the sculpture, he was seated on a magnificent throne of cedarwood, inlaid with ivory, gold, ebony, and precious stones. In Zeus' right hand there was a small statue of Nike, the goddess of victory, and in his left hand, a shining sceptre on which an eagle perched. Visitors like the Roman general Aemilius Paulus, the victor over Macedon, were moved to awe by the godlike majesty and splendor that Phidias had captured.[TAB]</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_BUILDING_OLMEC_HEAD_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English> The Olmec colossal heads are at least seventeen monumental stone representations of human heads sculpted from large basalt boulders. The heads date from at least before 900 BC and are a distinctive feature of the Olmec civilization of ancient Mesoamerica. All portray mature men with fleshy cheeks, flat noses, and slightly crossed eyes; their physical characteristics correspond to a type that is still common among the inhabitants of Tabasco and Veracruz. The backs of the monuments often are flat. The boulders were brought from the Sierra de los Tuxtlas mountains of Veracruz. Given that the extremely large slabs of stone used in their production were transported over large distances, requiring a great deal of human effort and resources, it is thought that the monuments represent portraits of powerful individual Olmec rulers. Each of the known examples has a distinctive headdress. The heads were variously arranged in lines or groups at major Olmec centres, but the method and logistics used to transport the stone to these sites remain unclear.
The discovery of a colossal head at Tres Zapotes in the nineteenth century spurred the first archaeological investigations of Olmec culture by Matthew Stirling in 1938. Seventeen confirmed examples are known from four sites within the Olmec heartland on the Gulf Coast of Mexico. Most colossal heads were sculpted from spherical boulders but two from San Lorenzo Tenochtitl&#225;n were re-carved from massive stone thrones. An additional monument, at Takalik Abaj in Guatemala, is a throne that may have been carved from a colossal head. This is the only known example from outside the Olmec heartland.
Dating the monuments remains difficult because of the movement of many from their original contexts prior to archaeological investigation. Most have been dated to the Early Preclassic period (1500-1000 BC) with some to the Middle Preclassic (1000-400 BC) period. The smallest weigh 6 tons, while the largest is variously estimated to weigh 40 to 50 tons, although it was abandoned and left unfinished close to the source of its stone.[TAB]</English>

This theatre was associated with the cult of Dionysus (the god of wine, theatre, and civilization), and from time immemorial the Greeks held dramas in his honor. Located in Athens on the southeast slope of the Acropolis, the Theatre of Dionysus was first constructed some time during the fifth century BC after the Persian Wars had ended. It was here that the religious festival of the Dionysia was staged each year, which lasted for ten days and was dedicated to the glory of the god.

		<English>[TAB]Gundeshapur was the intellectual center of the Sassanid empire and the home of the Academy of Gundishapur. Founded in 271 CE by the Sassanid king Shapur I, Gondeshapur was home to the world's oldest known teaching hospital, and also comprised a library and a university. It was located in the present-day province of Khuzestan, in the southwest of Iran, not far from the Karun river. The Manichean prophet Mani's imprisonment and death are also said to have taken place in Gondeshapur.[PARAGRAPH:1]Gondeshapur was one of the major cities in Khuzestan province of the Persian empire. The name Gondeshapur (Pahlavi Gund-i Shapur) comes from the compound term Gund-Dez-i Shapur "Citadel of Shapur". Most scholars believe Shapur I, son of Ardeshir (Artaxexes), to have founded the city after defeating a Roman army led by Emperor Valerian. Shapur II made Gondeshapur his capital. However, a few scholars believe that there may have been a city at this location under the Parthian dynasty of what is now Iran proper and Khvarvaran province what is today known as Iraq. [PARAGRAPH:2]In 489 CE, the Nestorian established scientific center in Edessa, was transferred to Vansibin, also known as "Nisibin, then under Persian rule with its secular faculties at Gundishapur, Khuzestan. Here, scholars, together with Pagan philosophers banished by Justinian from Athens carried out important r esearch in Medicine, Astronomy, and Mathematics". (Hill, p.4) However, it was under the rule of the Sassanid monarch Khusraw (531-579 CE), called Anushiravan "The Blessed" and known to the Greeks and Romans as Chosroes, that Gondeshapur became known for medicine and erudition. Khusraw I gave refuge to various Greek philosophers, Syriac-speaking Christians and Nestorians fleeing religious persecution by the Byzantine empire. The Sassanids had long battled the Romans and Byzantines for control of present day Iraq and Syria and were naturally disposed to welcome the refugees. It offered training in medicine, philosophy, theology and science. The faculty were versed not only in the Zoroastrian and Persian traditions, but in Greek and Indian learning as well. According to The Cambridge History of Iran, it was the most important medical center of the ancient world (defined as Europe, the Mediterranean, and the Near East) during the 6th and 7th centuries. (Vol 4, p396. ISBN 0-521-20093-8). Anushiravan also turned towards the east, and sent the famous physician Borzouye to invite Indian and Chinese scholars to Gondeshapur. These visitors translated Indian texts on astronomy, astrology, mathematics and medicine and Chinese texts on herbal medicine and religion. Borzouye is said to have himself translated the Pa&#241;catantra from Sanskrit into Persian as Kelile v&#230; Demne. [PARAGRAPH:3]According to Cyril Elgood in A Medical History of Persia, "to a very large extent, the credit for the whole hospital system must be given to Persia" (Cambridge University Press, p. 173). In addition to systemizing medical treatment and knowledge, the scholars of the academy also transformed medical education; rather than apprenticing with just one physician, medical students were required to work in the hospital under the supervision of the whole medical faculty. There is even evidence that graduates had to pass exams in order to practice as accredited Gondeshapur physicians (as recorded in an Arabic text, the Tarikhu l-Hikama). George Ghevarghese Joseph, in his Crest of the Peacock (Princeton University Press, 2000) claims that Gondeshapur also had a pivotal role in the history of mathematics.[PARAGRAPH:4]The Sassanid dynasty fell to Muslim Arab armies in 638 CE. The academy survived the change of rulers and persisted for several centuries as a Muslim institute of higher learning. It was later rivaled by an institute established at the Abbasid capital of Baghdad. In 832 CE, Caliph al-Ma'mun founded the famous Baytu l-Hikma, the House of Wisdom. There the methods of Gundishapur were emulated; indeed, the House of Wisdom was staffed with graduates of the older Academy of Gondeshapur. It is believed that the House of Wisdom was disbanded under Al-Mutawakkil, Al-Ma'mun's successor. However, by that time the intellectual center of the Abbasid Caliphate had definitively shifted to Baghdad, as henceforth there are few references in contemporary literature to universities or hospitals at Gondeshapur. The significance of the center gradually declined. According to LeStrange's 1905 compendium of Arab geographers, The Lands of the Eastern Caliphate, the 10th century writer Muqaddasi described Gondeshapur as falling into ruins (LeStrange, 1905, p. 238).</English>

Asclepius was probably first worshipped as a hero in Trikka, Thessaly, which ancient mythographers generally regarded as the place of his birth. Epidauros, on the other hand, was the first place to worship Asclepius as a god, beginning sometime in the 400's BC. The asclepieion at Epidaurus is both extensive and well preserved. There is an asclepieion located on the south slopes of the Acropolis of Athens which dates to around 420 BC.
Starting around 350 BC, the cult of Asclepius became increasingly popular. Pilgrims flocked to asclepieia to be healed. They slept overnight ("incubation") and reported their dreams to a priest the following day. He prescribed a cure, often a visit to the baths or a gymnasium. Since snakes were sacred to Asclepius, they were often used in healing rituals. Non-venomous snakes were left to crawl on the floor in dormitories where the sick and injured slept.

It was first built in 1841, by architect Gottfried Semper, in the Early Renaissance style. It had to be rebuilt after a fire destroyed it in 1869. The citizenry demanded that Gottfried Semper do the reconstruction, even though he was in exile at the time because of his activities in the May Uprising in Dresden in 1849.
The building is considered to be a prime example of "Dresden-Baroque" architecture. It is situated on the Theater Square in central Dresden on the bank of the Elbe River. On top of the portal there is a Pantherquadriga with a statue of Dionysos. The interior was created by such famous architects of the time as Johannes Schilling. Monuments on the portal depict famous artists such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller, William Shakespeare, Sophocles, Moli&#232;re and Euripides. The building also features work by Ernst Rietschel and Ernst Julius H&#228;hnel.
So the architect had his son Manfred Semper complete the second opera house with his father's plans. This second one was constructed in Neo-Renaissance style in 1878. During construction, performances were held at the Gewerbehausall, which opened in 1870.
In the pre-war years, the building premiered many of the works of Richard Strauss.
During the last weeks of World War II in 1945 the building was destroyed again - this time by Allied bombing and the subsequent fire storms. Exactly 40 years later, on February 13, 1985 the opera was rebuilt almost the same as it was before the war. It reopened with the same opera that was performed last before the destruction in 1945: Weber's Der Freisch&#252;tz. (Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] The word "caravan" has a Persian root and in ancient times referred to those who traveled the silk road. The road itself was a series of interconnected routes through Southern Asia connecting Chang'an (today's Xi'an), China, with Antioch, Asia Minor. A caravanserai, or caravan house, was a roadside inn where caravans could rest and recover from the day's journey. Caravan houses were typically square or rectangular walled buildings, with a single portal wide enough to allow the entry of large or heavily laden beasts such as camels. The courtyard usually opened to the sky, and along the inner walls were a number of stalls and chambers to accommodate merchants, their animals, and merchandise.</English>

The height of the palisade varied from a few feet, to ten feet or more. In the ancient world, palisades were effective protection for short-term conflicts, and as deterrents to small forces. However, due to their nature, they were very susceptible to fire and siege weapons. In areas where conflict was expected stone walls were preferred to wooden palisades.</English>

		<English>[TAB] As cities grew in the 19th century, increasing concerns were raised about public health. As part of a trend of municipal sanitation programs in the late 19th and 20th centuries, many cities constructed extensive sewer systems to help control outbreaks of disease such as typhoid and cholera. Initially these systems discharged sewage directly to surface waters without treatment. Later, cities attempted to treat the sewage before discharge in order to prevent water pollution and waterborne diseases. During the half-century around 1900, these public health interventions succeeded in drastically reducing the incidence of water-borne diseases among the urban population, and were an important cause in the increases of life expectancy experienced at the time.</English>

		<English>[TAB] Wood is one of mankind's oldest building materials. The ability to shape wood improved with technological advances from the stone age to the bronze age to the iron age. Relatively little information about carpentry is available from pre-history (before written language) or even recent centuries because the knowledge and skills were passed down person to person, rarely in writing, until the printing press was invented in the 15th century and builders began regularly publishing guides and pattern books in the 18th and 19th centuries. The oldest surviving, complete architectural text is Vitruvius' ten books collectively titled De architectura which discusses some carpentry.
Some of the oldest, surviving, wooden buildings in the world are the temples in China such as the Nanchan Temple built in the year 782, the Greensted Church parts of which are from the 11th century, the stave churchs in Norway from the 12th and 13th centuries.

		<English>[TAB] Ctesiphon is one of the great cities of ancient Iran and the capital of the Parthian Empire and its successor, the Sassanid Empire, for more than 800 years located in the ancient Iranian province of Khvarvaran. The splendor of imperial palace complex at Ctesiphon to include Khosrau's palace (Sh&#226;hig&#226;n-i Sepid = the white palace (now almost totally ruined) and the great arch (now, Taq-i-Kisra) remained legendary. 
		Construction began during the reign of Khosrau I after a campaign against the Byzantines in 540 AD. The arched iwan hall, open on the facade side, was about 37 meters high 26 meters across and 50 meters long, the largest vault ever constructed at the time.
The arch was part of the imperial palace complex. The Throne room-presumably under or behind the arch-was more than 30 m (110 ft) high and covered an area 24 m (80 ft) wide by 48 m (160 ft) long. The top of the arch is about 1 meter thick while the walls at the base are up to 7 meters thick. It was the largest vault ever constructed in Persia. The inverse catenary arch was built without centring. In order to make this possible a number of techniques were used. The bricks were laid about 18 degrees from the vertical which allowed them to be partially supported by the rear wall during construction. The quick drying cement used as mortar allowed the fresh bricks to be quickly supported by those that were previously laid.
The Taq-i Kisra is now all that remains above ground of a city that was, for seven centuries, the main capital of the successor dynasties of the Seleucids, Parthians and Sassanids of Persia. The structure left today was the main portico of the audience hall of the Sassanids who maintained the same site chosen by the Parthians and for the same reason, namely proximity to the Roman Empire whose expansionist aims could be better contained at the point of contact.
The structure was captured and looted by Arabs in AD 637. They then used it as a mosque for a while until the area was gradually abandoned.</English>

		<English>[TAB] The Reichstag building in Berlin was constructed to house the Reichstag, the original parliament of the German Empire. It was opened in 1894 and housed the Reichstag until 1933. It again became the seat of the German parliament in 1999 after a reconstruction led by internationally renowned architect Norman Foster. Today's parliament of Germany is called the Bundestag. The Reichstag as a parliament dates back to the Holy Roman Empire and ceased to act as a true parliament in the years of Nazi Germany (1933-1945). In today's usage, the German term Reichstag refers to the building, while the term Bundestag refers to the institution.[PARAGRAPH:1]Construction of the building began only well after 1871. Previously, the parliament had assembled in several other buildings in the Leipziger Stra&#223;e in Berlin; but these were generally considered too small, so in 1872 an architectural contest with 103 participating architects was carried out to erect an all-new building. Work did not start until ten years later though, due to various problems with purchasing property for the new building and arguments between Wilhelm I, Otto von Bismarck, and the members of the Reichstag about how the construction should be performed.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1882, another architectural contest was held, with 189 architects participating. This time the winner, the Frankfurt architect Paul Wallot, would actually have his plan executed. On June 9, 1884, the foundation stone was finally laid by Wilhelm I. Before construction was completed in 1894, Wilhelm I died (in 1888, the Year of Three Emperors). His successor, Wilhelm II, objected to parliament as an institution to a much greater extent. The original building was most acclaimed for the construction of an original cupola of steel and glass, an engineering masterpiece of the time.[PARAGRAPH:3]After World War I had ended and the Kaiser had abdicated, during the revolutionary days of 1918, Philipp Scheidemann proclaimed the institution of a republic from one of the balconies of the Reichstag building on November 9. The building continued to be the seat of the parliament of the Weimar Republic (1919-1933), which was still called Reichstag.</English>

[PARAGRAPH:1]Es folgten noch viele geschichtliche Ereignisse, die erheblichen Einfluss auf die jeweilige Zeit hatten. So rief der Sozialdemokrat Philipp Scheidemann am 9. November 1918 von einem Fenster des Reichstages die Weimarer Republik aus.

Auf vielen Bildern ist das Hissen der sowjetischen Fahne auf dem Dach des Reichstages dokumentiert. Es war ein Symbol f&#252;r die Beendigung des Zweiten Weltkrieges.

As the office of the U.S. President, the term "White House" is used as a metonym for a U.S. president's administration. The property is owned by the National Park Service and is part of "President's Park."[PARAGRAPH:1] The building Hoban designed was largely modeled on the first and second floors of Leinster House, a ducal palace in Dublin, Ireland, which is now the seat of the Irish Parliament. Construction began with the laying of the cornerstone on October 13, 1792. While the White House remains a continuing symbol of American democracy, the house also reflects the nation's early involvement with the institution of slavery. A diary kept by the District of Columbia building commissioner records that the footings for the main residence were dug by slaves. The foundations were also built by slave labor. Much of the other work on the house was performed by immigrants, many not yet with citizenship. The sandstone walls were erected by Scottish immigrants, as were the high relief rose and garland decorations above the north entrance and the "fish scale" pattern beneath the pediments of the window hoods. Much of the brick and plaster work was produced by Irish and Italian immigrants. The initial construction took place over a period of eight years, at a reported cost of $232,371.83 ($2.4 million in 2005 dollars). Although not yet completed, the White House was ready for occupancy on or about November 1, 1800.[PARAGRAPH:2]Today the White House is a complex of three buildings. The original residence is in the center, two colonnades - one on the east and the west designed by Jefferson now serve to connect to the later East and West Wings.

		<English>[TAB] The Teatro alla Scala (or La Scala, as it is known), in Milan, Italy, is the world's most famous opera house. The theatre was inaugurated on 3 August 1778, under the name Nuovo Regio Ducal Teatro alla Scala with Salieri's L'Europa riconosciuta.
The current edifice is the second theatre on the site. A fire destroyed the first, the ancient Teatro Ducale, on 25 February 1776, after a carnival gala. A group of ninety wealthy Milanese, who owned palchi (private boxes) in the theater, wrote to Archduke Ferdinand I of Austria asking for a new theatre and a provisional one to be used while completing the new one. The neoclassical architect Giuseppe Piermarini produced an initial design but it was rejected by Count Firmian (an Austrian governor).
A second plan was accepted in 1776 by Empress Maria Theresa. The new theatre was built on the former location of the church of Santa Maria della Scala, from which the theatre gets its name. The church was deconsecrated and demolished, and over a period of two years the theater was completed by Pietro Marliani, Pietro Nosetti and Antonio and Giuseppe Fe. This theatre had a total over 3,000 seats organized into 678 pit-stalls, arranged in six tiers of boxes above which is the 'loggione' or two galleries. The stage is one of the largest in Italy; the proscenium is 26m wide and 27m high, and the stage was originally 20m deep.
Building expenses were covered by the sale of palchi, which were lavishly decorated by their owners, impressing observers such as Stendhal. La Scala (as it soon became to be known) soon became the preeminent meeting place for noble and wealthy Milanese people. In the tradition of the times, the platea (the main floor) had no chairs and spectators watched the shows standing up. The orchestra was in full sight, as the golfo mistico (orchestra pit) had not yet been built.
Above the boxes, La Scala has always had a gallery where the less wealthy can watch the performances. It is called the loggione. The loggione is typically crowded with the most critical opera aficionados, who can be ecstatic or merciless towards singers' perceived successes or failures. La Scala's loggione is considered a baptism of fire in the opera world, and fiascos are long remembered. As with most of the theaters at that time, La Scala was also a casino, with gamblers sitting in the foyer.
La Scala was originally illuminated with eighty-four oil lamps mounted on the palcoscenico and another thousand in the rest of theater. To prevent the risks of fire, several rooms were filled with hundreds of water buckets. In time, oil lamps were replaced by gas lamps, these in turn were replaced by electric lights in 1883.
The original structure was renovated in 1907, when it was given its current layout with 2,800 seats. In 1943, during WWII, La Scala was severely damaged by bombing. It was rebuilt and reopened on May 11, 1946, with a memorable concert conducted by Arturo Toscanini, with a soprano solo by Renata Tebaldi, which created a sensation.
La Scala hosted the prima (first production) of many famous operas, and had a special relationship with Giuseppe Verdi. For several years, however, Verdi did not allow his work to be played here, as some of his music had been modified (he said "corrupted") by the orchestra.
La Scala's season traditionally opens on December 7, Saint Ambrose's Day, Milan's patron saint. All performances must end before midnight; long operas start earlier in the evening if need be. Ticketholders are not allowed to enter after the performance has begun. No exceptions are made, as Richard Burton once discovered.</English>
		<German>[TAB] Das Teatro alla Scala (auch: Mail&#228;nder Scala) ist ein am 3. August 1778 er&#246;ffnetes Opernhaus in Mailand, welches das 1776 abgebrannte Teatro Regio Ducale ersetzte. Maria Theresia lie&#223; f&#252;r den Neubau die Kirche Santa Maria della Scala (1381, benannt nach Beatrice Regina della Scala, der Gemahlin von Bernabo Visconti) abrei&#223;en und durch den klassizistischen Architekten Giuseppe Piermarini das eher schlicht wirkende neue Opernhaus in nur 23 Monaten errichten. Zur Premiere wurde Antonio Salieris Oper L'Europa riconosciuta aufgef&#252;hrt.
Die Saison beginnt allj&#228;hrlich am 7. Dezember, dem Namenstag des Stadtpatrons von Mailand, des Hl. Ambrosius (Sant'Ambrogio).
Nach v&#246;lligen Zerst&#246;rungen im Zweiten Weltkrieg (1943) war das legend&#228;re Opernhaus in Rekordzeit wieder aufgebaut worden. Am 11. Mai 1946 wird das Haus mit einem Konzert unter Arturo Toscanini wiederer&#246;ffnet. Dem &#252;berhasteten Wiederaufbau waren verschiedene Fehler geschuldet, so wurde etwa Bauschutt unter dem Orchestergraben abgelagert, was die Akustik beeintr&#228;chtigte. Eine Grundsanierung wurde dringend erforderlich. Eine heftige Diskussion &#252;ber die Art der Sanierung entbrannte. Trotz erheblichen Protests, einer Sammlung von 18.000 Unterschriften durch die Primaballerina Carla Fracci und Gerichtsverhandlungen wurde die Scala abgerissen. Nur noch das Foyer, der Zuschauerraum und die von Stahltr&#228;gern gest&#252;tzten Au&#223;enmauern blieben stehen. Der gesamte hintere Teil, beginnend mit der B&#252;hne aus Holz, wurde entfernt.
Von 2001 bis Anfang Dezember 2004 war die Mail&#228;nder Scala geschlossen, um Akustik und B&#252;hnentechnik auf den neuesten Stand zu bringen und dabei doch den Stil der urspr&#252;nglichen Inneneinrichtung weitgehend zu erhalten.
F&#252;r den Wiederaufbau wurde der Schweizer Architekt Mario Botta beauftragt. Unter seiner Verantwortung entstand ein Theater mit modernster B&#252;hnentechnik. Aber Foyer und Zuschauerraum erhalten ihre originale Ausstattung von 1778. So kann seither auf drei B&#252;hnen gleichzeitig geprobt werden. Der neue B&#252;hnenturm erreicht eine H&#246;he von 38 Meter.
Wieder er&#246;ffnet wurde das Opernhaus am 7. Dezember 2004 mit der Oper, die zur Erster&#246;ffnung uraufgef&#252;hrt wurde: L'Europa riconosciuta. Regie f&#252;hrte Luca Ronconi, die Ausstattung entwarf Pier Luigi Pizzi, Dirigent war Riccardo Muti, die Hauptrolle sang die deutsche Sopranistin Diana Damrau. Unter den 2.000 geladenen G&#228;sten waren unter anderem Sophia Loren, Giorgio Armani sowie Angeh&#246;rige mehrerer europ&#228;ischer K&#246;nigsh&#228;user. Eine Eintrittskarte zur Er&#246;ffnungsveranstaltung kostete bis zu 2.000 Euro.
Ein Konflikt entz&#252;ndete sich an der Person des Nachfolgers von Intendant Carlo Fontana. Musikdirektor Muti favorisierte Maurizio Meli, gegen den sich jedoch die Belegschaft in Protestversammlungen aussprach. Die Wogen schlugen so hoch, dass Muti schlie&#223;lich das Vertrauen in seine Personen nicht mehr gegeben sah und zur&#252;cktrat. Schlie&#223;lich kristallisierten sich St&#233;phane Lissner, Intendant des Festivals in Aix-en-Provence sowie Musikintendant der Wiener Festwochen, und Alexander Pereira, Direktor des Opernhauses Z&#252;rich als wichtigste Nachfolgekandidaten heraus. Lissner wurde schlie&#223;lich bestellt und gab daf&#252;r seine Position in Aix auf. Er will die Scala wieder als ernstzunehmendes, wichtiges europ&#228;isches Opernhaus in der &#246;ffentlichen Aufmerksamkeit etablieren und plant, die zuletzt schmal gewordene Riege an Gastdirigenten zu erweitern, wichtige Regisseure zu verpflichten und die Zahl der Vorstellungen zu erh&#246;hen.</German>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_BUILDING_PROPAGANDA_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB] Propaganda is a type of message aimed at influencing the opinions or behavior of people. Instead of impartially providing information, propaganda is often deliberately misleading, using logical fallacies, which, while sometimes convincing, are not necessarily valid. Propaganda techniques include: patriotic flag-waving, glittering generalities, intentional vagueness, oversimplification of complex issues, rationalization, introducing unrelated red herring issues, using appealing, simple slogans, stereotyping, testimonials from authority figures or celebrities, unstated assumptions, and encouraging readers or viewers to "jump on the bandwagon" of a particular point of view.
Propaganda was often used to appeal influence opinion and beliefs on religious issues, particularly during the split between the Catholic Church and the Reformers. Propaganda has become more common in political contexts, in particular to refer to certain efforts sponsored by governments, political groups, but also often covert interests. In the early 20th century the term propaganda was also used by the founders of the nascent public relations industry to describe their activities. This usage died out around the time of World War II, as the industry started to avoid the word, given the pejorative connotation it had acquired.
Literally translated from the Latin gerundive as "things which must be disseminated," in some cultures the term is neutral or even positive, while in others the term has acquired a strong negative connotation. The connotations of the term "propaganda" can also vary over time. For example, in Portuguese and some Spanish language speaking countries, particularly in the Southern Cone, the word "propaganda" usually means the most common manipulation of information - "advertising".
In English, "propaganda" was originally a neutral term used to describe the dissemination of information in favor of any given cause. During the 20th century, however, the term acquired a thoroughly negative meaning in western countries, of equalling the intentional dissemination of false, but perhaps "compelling", claims supporting or justifying nefarious political ideologies.
This redefinition arose because both the Soviet Union and Germany's government under Hitler admitted explicitly to using propaganda favoring, respectively, communism and fascism, in all forms of public expression. As these ideologies were antipathetic to English-language and other western societies, the negative feelings toward them came to be projected into the word "propaganda" itself. Nowadays nobody admits doing propaganda but, on the other side, everybody accuses the opponent of using propaganda, whenever there is an opponent in question.</English>
		<German>[TAB] Unter Propaganda versteht man die gezielte und organisierte Verbreitung einer Nachricht oder Ideologie, meist im politischen Umfeld. Der Propagandatreibende hat das Ziel, das soziale Handeln und Denken anderer im eigenen Sinn zu beeinflussen. Eine jeweils konkret verbreitete Information kann richtig oder falsch sein.
Gelegentlich bezeichnet "Propaganda" auch die Werbung in der Wirtschaft. Im Gro&#223;- und Einzelhandel wird z. B. die Verkostung oder das Verteilen von Warenproben, oder die Demonstration von Produkten als "Propaganda" bezeichnet, der entsprechende Mitarbeiter als Propagandist.
Besonders perfide, denunziatorische und blutr&#252;nstige Propaganda wird h&#228;ufig als Gr&#228;uelpropaganda bezeichnet.</German>

Individual television stations are usually granted licenses by a government agency to use a particular section of the radio spectrum (a channel) through which they send their signals. Some stations use LPTV broadcast translators to retransmit to further areas. 
		Television has always been used for propaganda and for justifying foreign affairs. Nazi Germany in 1933 - 1945 was the first country to use efficiently propaganda campaigns in order to get the population support.

The hall was originally to have been called The Central Hall of Arts and Sciences, but the name was changed by Queen Victoria when laying the foundation stone. It forms the practical part of a national memorial to the Prince Consort - the decorative part is the Albert Memorial directly to the north in Kensington Gardens, now separated from the Hall by the heavy traffic along Kensington Gore. The hall also accommodates the largest pipe organ in the UK, and is the home of The Proms.
As the best known building within the cultural complex known as Albertopolis, the hall is commonly and erroneously thought to lie within the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.

		<English>[TAB] The Goetheanum is a center for the anthroposophical movement in Dornach, Switzerland. It is named after Johann Wolfgang Goethe.
The First Goetheanum, a wooden structure designed by Rudolf Steiner, is generally considered a masterpiece of 20th century architecture:
The building, built initially between 1913 and 1919 to house the annual summer theater events of the Anthroposophical Society, became the center of a small colony of spiritual seekers located in Dornach and based around Rudolf Steiner. A rich artistic life was centered around the creation of the building: stained glass windows poured color into the space, painters decorated the ceiling with motifs depicting the whole of human evolution, sculptors carved huge column bases, capitals and architraves with images of metamorphoses, architects created the unusual double-dome wooden structure over a curving concrete base. Already during the construction, musicians, actors and movement artists began performing a wide variety of pieces in a neighboring workshop. When the Goetheanum hall was completed, these performances moved onto the stage located under the Goetheanum's smaller cupola. The auditorium was located under the larger cupola.
This unique building succumbed to arson on New Year's Eve, 1922/23.
In the course of 1923, Steiner designed a building to replace the original. This building, now known as the Second Goetheanum, was wholly built of concrete cast into intricate forms. Begun in 1924, the building was not completed until 1928, after the architect's death. It represents an early use of concrete for such architectural purposes and has now been granted protected status as a Swiss national cultural landmark.
The present Goetheanum houses a 1000-seat auditorium, now the center of a rich performance life incorporating performances of local theater and eurythmy troupes as well as visiting performers from around the world; see the performance calendar.
The building also houses the world offices of the Anthroposophical Society. Conferences focusing on themes of general interest occur several times a year. Specialist conferences for teachers, farmers, doctors, therapists and many other professions are held regularly, as well. These conferences are also listed on the calendar.
The Goetheanum is open for visitors seven days a week and offers tours several times daily. (Wikipedia)</English>

This empire ruled territory now falling within the modern states of Zimbabwe (which took its name from this city) and Mozambique. They traded with the world via ports such as Sofala south of the Zambezi Delta.
Great Zimbabwe is modern Zimbabwe's national shrine, where the Zimbabwe Bird (a national symbol of Zimbabwe) was found. It is currently an archaeological site. (Wikipedia)</English>
		<German>[TAB] Great Zimbabwe war von 1200 bis ins 15. Jahrhundert hinein eine bedeutende Stadt im s&#252;dlichen Afrika. Sie liegt 39 km von Masvingo (fr&#252;her Fort Viktoria) entfernt in der Masvingo-Provinz in Simbabwe und war Zentrum des Munhumutapa-Reiches (auch Monomotapa-Reich), welches das au&#223;er dem heutige Simbabwe Teile von Mosambik umfasste.
Simbabwe verdankt seinen Namen der Stadt. Der erste Teil des Namens, "dzimba" ist der Plural vom "imba", dem Shona-Wort f&#252;r Haus. Die Bedeutung des zweiten Namensteils ist unklar. Zimbabwe k&#246;nnte von "zimba mabwe" = "Steinh&#228;user" kommen oder von "dzimba woye" = "geehrte H&#228;user"), ein begriff, der meist f&#252;r die Gr&#228;ber und H&#228;user der H&#228;uptlinge angewandt wurde.
Great Zimbabwe, 2300 km s&#252;dlich des &#196;quators, ist eine der &#228;ltesten steinernen Bauanlagen s&#252;dlich der Sahara. Allerdings wurden etwa zur selben Zeit an der afrikanischen Ostk&#252;ste bis 900 km s&#252;dlich des &#196;quators von arabischen Bauherren ausgefeilte steinerne Gew&#246;lbe gebaut. Den beindruckend hohen Trockenmauern von Great Zimbabwe fehlen sogar Eckverbindungen. Und sie haben - trotz des Namens - nie D&#228;cher getragen. Es waren steinerne Einfriedungen. In den so eingefriedeten H&#246;fen standen H&#252;tten und H&#228;user aus Lehm und Holz.
Es gibt deutliche Hinweise, aber keinen 100%igen Beweis, dass die Erbauer und Bewohner der heute so beeindruckenden Gem&#228;uer Vorfahren der heutigen Shona waren, des Bantuvolkes, das etwa 4/5 der Bev&#246;lkerung der Republik Simbabwe stellt. Die noch vorhandenen Ruinen der Stadt bedecken eine Fl&#228;che von 7 km&#178; und sind in drei Gebiete unterteilt: Der Hill Complex, der Valley Complex und das Great Enclosure.
Die ersten Europ&#228;er, welche die Ruinen antrafen, waren die Portugiesen im 16. Jahrhundert. Sie trugen auch die Legende nach Europa, dass die Stadt die Heimat der K&#246;nigin von Saba gewesen sein soll. Die St&#228;tte wurde 1871 von Karl Mauch wiederentdeckt und wurde in der Folgezeit mit dem biblischen Goldland Ophir gleichgesetzt. Die Ruinen sind seitdem eine sehr wichtige St&#228;tte der Arch&#228;ologie des s&#252;dlichen Afrika, wobei anzumerken ist, dass der schwarzafrikanische Ursprung der Ruinenst&#228;tte w&#228;hrend der wei&#223;en Herrschaft in Rhodesien, wie Simbabwe bis zur &#220;bernahme der Macht durch die schwarze Mehrheit hie&#223;, offiziell immer bestritten wurde. Neben den Ph&#246;niziern wurden auch andere, ausschlie&#223;lich hellh&#228;utige Eroberer als Gr&#252;nder bezeichnet.
Der Arch&#228;ologe Graham Connah, der sich der Erforschung der vorkolonialen Kulturen Schwarzafrikas gewidmet hat, nimmt an, dass die Stadt am Ende des Mittelalters aufgegeben werden musste, weil die dauernde &#220;berbesiedlung zu einer &#246;kologischen Katastrophe gef&#252;hrt hatte.

		<English>[TAB] The Porcelain Tower (or Porcelain Pagoda) of Nanjing, also known as Bao'ensi (meaning "Temple of Gratitude"), is a historical site located on the south bank of the Yangtze in Nanjing, China. It was a pagoda constructed in the 15th century during the Ming Dynasty, but was mostly destroyed in the 19th century during the course of the Taiping Rebellion.
		The Porcelain Tower of Nanjing was designed during reign of the Yongle Emperor (r. 1402-1424) shortly before its construction, in the early 15th century. It was first discovered by the Western world when European travelers like Johan Nieuhof visited it, sometimes listing it as one of the Seven Wonders of the World. After this exposure to the outside world, the tower was seen as a national treasure to both locals and other cultures around the world.
In 1801, the tower was struck by lightning and the top three stories were knocked off, but it was soon restored. The 1843 book The Closing Events of the Campaign in China by Granville Gower Loch contains a detailed description of the tower as it existed in the early 1840s. In the 1850s, the area surrounding the tower erupted in civil war as the Taiping Rebellion reached Nanjing and the Taiping Rebels took over the city. They smashed the Buddhist images and destroyed the inner staircase to deny the Qing enemy an observation platform. American sailors reached the city in May 1854 and visited the hollowed tower. In 1856, the Taiping destroyed the tower either in order to prevent a hostile faction from using it to observe and shell the city or from superstitious fear of its geomantic properties. After this, the tower's remnants were salvaged for use in other buildings, while the site lay dormant until a recent surge to try to rebuild the landmark.(Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] The Castillo de Chapultepec (translated as "Castle of Chapultepec") is a castle built on top of Chapultepec Hill (Chapultepec comes from the n&#225;huatl and means "grasshopper hill"), located in the middle of Chapultepec Park in Mexico City at a height of 2,325 meters above sea level. The building has been used for several purposes during its history, including Military Academy, Imperial and Presidential residence, observatory and museum. It currently houses the Mexican National Museum of History. It is the only castle in North America that was occupied by sovereigns. (Wikipedia)</English>
		<German>[TAB]Am H&#252;gel von Chapultepec befindet sich das Schloss Maximilians. Davor steht das "Monumento a los Ni&#241;os H&#233;roes", ein Ehrenmal f&#252;r die Kadetten, die das Schloss gegen die US-Armee im Mexikanisch-Amerikanischen Krieg 1847 zu verteidigen suchten. Der Legende nach haben sich die letzten sechs &#220;berlebenden in die Nationalflagge geh&#252;llt von den Klippen zu Tode gest&#252;rzt, um nicht den feindlichen Truppen in die H&#228;nde zu fallen.
Das Castillo selbst wurde 1785 als Sommerresidenz des spanischen Vizek&#246;nigs erbaut. Bis dahin war es eine Einsiedelei, die nach dem Verschwinden des Aztekenherrschers errichtet worden war. Als Milit&#228;rakademie wurde es bis zur Unabh&#228;ngigkeit genutzt, die heutige Gestalt erhielt das Schloss auf Wunsch von Kaiser Maximilian, der es nach dem Muster seiner italienischen Villa umbauen lie&#223;. Jetzt beherbergt es auf zwei Stockwerken das "Museo Nacional de Historica".

		<English>[TAB] Al Khazneh (The Treasury) (Arabic) is one of the most elaborate buildings in the ancient city of Petra in Jordan. The building is carved out of sandstone and is a popular tourist attraction.
It is called the treasury because for a long time, bedouins who lived in that area believed that the urn on top of the building contained valuable treasures. Bullet marks are visible on the urn itself, as evidence of attempts to "break" it and claim the treasure. Such attempts would have proved fruitless, as the urn -- like the structures surrounding it -- is solid rock.
Factually speaking however, it appears that the building isn't actually a treasury, but a temple of some kind.
The entrance to the treasury is through a long, dark, rock passage called al-Siq (meaning the shaft). (Wikipedia)</English>
		<German>[TAB] An der Einm&#252;ndung des Siq in den Talkessel steht das wohl ber&#252;hmteste Bauwerk Petras, das fast 40 Meter hohe, im hellenistischen Stil erbaute Khazne al-Firaun. Das "Schatzhaus des Pharao", wie es von den Beduinen genannt wurde, war in Wirklichkeit eines von zahlreichen Felsgr&#228;bern. Es wurde m&#246;glicherweise f&#252;r den Nabat&#228;erk&#246;nig Aretas IV. angelegt, der im 1. Jahrhundert v. Chr. regierte. Andere Forscher datieren das Khazne dagegen erst ins 2. Jahrhundert n. Chr., in die Zeit des Kaisers Hadrian. &#220;ber einem Portikus aus sechs korinthischen S&#228;ulen erhebt sich eine kleine, von zwei Halbgiebeln flankierte Tholos, ein Rundtempel. Zwischen den S&#228;ulen befinden sich verwitterte Reste von Relieffiguren. An der Urne, auf der Spitze des Rundtempels, sind Einschussl&#246;cher zu erkennen. Sie gehen auf Flintensch&#252;sse von Beduinen zur&#252;ck, die einst versucht hatten, den vermeintlichen Schatzbeh&#228;lter aufzubrechen. Die Urne besteht aber, wie der gesamte Bau und die anderen K&#246;nigsgr&#228;ber Petras, &#252;berwiegend aus massivem Fels.

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_BUILDING_MOLE_ANTONELLIANA_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB] The Mole Antonelliana is a major landmark of the Italian city Turin. It is named for the architect who built it, Alessandro Antonelli. Construction began in 1863.
Originally, it was intended to be a Jewish synagogue, as religious freedom had just been granted to non-Catholic groups, but the relationship between Antonelli and the Jewish community was not a happy one. He immediately began to propose a series of modifications which raised the final height to 113 meters--over 47 meters higher than the dome in the original design. Such changes, in addition to greater costs and construction time than were originally anticipated, did not please the Jewish community and construction was halted in 1869 with a provisional roof. In 1873 an exchange with the city of Turin for other land for a synagogue took place, and the Mole was dedicated to Victor Emanuel II. Antonelli again began construction, which took the height to 146, 153, and finally 167 meters (548 feet).
Since 2000, the building houses Museo Nazionale del Cinema, the National Museum of Film. The Mole appears on the reverse of the two cent Italian euro coins and was the official emblem of the 2006 Winter Olympics. It is also the official emblem of the 2005 World Bocce Championships and the 2006 World Fencing Championships.
On one side of the four-faced dome, the first Fibonacci numbers are written with red neon lights: they are part of the artistic work Il volo dei Numeri ("Flight of the numbers") by Mario Merz. (Wikipedia)</English>
		<German>[TAB] Die Mole Antonelliana (ital. mole "Bauwerk") ist das Wahrzeichen der italienischen Stadt Turin. Der pavillonartige Bau mit seinem hohen, sich stark verj&#252;ngenden Aufsatz entstand in den Jahren 1863-1888 nach Pl&#228;nen des Turiner Architekten Alessandro Antonelli (1798-1888). Er war im Auftrag der j&#252;dischen Gemeinde als Synagoge begonnen worden und urspr&#252;nglich mit 280.000 Lire veranschlagt. Der &#252;bersteigerte Ehrgeiz des Architekten, ein einzigartiges, meisterhaftes Bauwerk zu errichten, lie&#223; die Kosten derart explodieren, dass 1876 schon 692.000 Lire ausgegeben waren, das Geb&#228;ude aber immer noch nicht fertiggestellt war. Trotz ambitionierter Versuche konnte die j&#252;dische Gemeinde schlie&#223;lich kein Geld mehr aufbringen und das Objekt wurde dank einer B&#252;rgerinitiative im Jahr 1877 von der Stadt &#252;bernommen, die 1895 ein Museum des Risorgimento einrichtete.
Mit einer H&#246;he von 167,50 Metern war die Mole bei ihrer Fertigstellung das h&#246;chste begehbare Geb&#228;ude der Welt; sie &#252;bertraf den acht Jahre zuvor vollendeten K&#246;lner Dom um elf Meter. Nur der Obelisk des vier Jahre zuvor fertiggestellen Denkmals f&#252;r George Washington war 180 Zentimeter h&#246;her. Die Kuppelkonstruktion gilt als das &#196;u&#223;erste, das in traditioneller Bauweise (ohne Eisenbeton) hergestellt werden kann. Antonelli konnte die gewaltigen Ausma&#223;e erreichen, indem er die ziegelgemauerten W&#228;nde mit Lisenen verst&#228;rkte und dadurch bei einer verh&#228;ltnism&#228;&#223;ig gro&#223;en Leichtigkeit eine hohe Stabilit&#228;t erzielte. Bis heute ist die Mole das h&#246;chste in Ziegelmauertechnik ausgef&#252;hrte Bauwerk der Welt.
1954 musste der Turm nach einem Blitzeinschlag in die Eisenkonstruktion neu errichtet werden.
Italienische Zwei-Cent-M&#252;nze
Nach dem Vorbild der Mole entstand die Kuppel des Reichsgerichts in Leipzig.
Das Geb&#228;ude beherbergt heute das bedeutendste Filmmuseum Italiens (Museo Nazionale del Cinema). Im Inneren f&#252;hrt ein frei schwebender gl&#228;serner Aufzug zur Aussichtsplattform. Von hier hat man eine wunderbare Sicht &#252;ber die Stadt und bei (dem seltenen) klaren Wetter bis zu den Alpen.
Die Mole Antonelliana ist auf der italienischen 2-Cent-M&#252;nze dargestellt. Sie war auch Vorbild f&#252;r das offizielle Logo der Olympischen Winterspiele 2006 in Turin. (Wikipedia)</German>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_BUILDING_SLAVE_MARKET_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB] Slavery is a social-economic system under which certain persons - known as slaves - are deprived of their personal freedom and compelled to provide their labour or services. The term also refers to the status or condition of those persons, who are treated as the property of another person or household. Slaves are held against their will from the time of their capture, purchase, or birth, and are deprived of the right to leave, to refuse to work, or to receive compensation in return for their labour. As such, slavery is one form of unfree labour.
Historically, most slaves ancestors were initially captured in wars or kidnapped in isolated raids but some were sold into slavery by their parents as a means of surviving extreme conditions. Most slaves were born into that status. Ancient societies characterized by poverty, rampant warfare or lawlessness, famines, population pressures, and cultural and technological lag are frequently exporters of slaves to more developed nations. Today the illegal slave trade (mostly in Africa) deals with slaves who are rural people forced to move to cities, or those purchased in rural areas and sold into slavery in cities. These moves take place due to loss of subsistence agriculture, thefts of land, and population increases. In many ancient cultures, persons (often including their family) convicted of serious crimes could be sold into slavery. Also, persons have been sold into slavery so that the money could be used to pay off their debts. This could range from a judge, king or Emperor ordering a debtor sold with all his family, to the poor selling off their own children to prevent starvation. In times of dire need such as famine, people have offered themselves into slavery not for a purchase price, but merely so that their new master would feed and take care of them. (Wikipedia)</English>
		<German>[TAB] Bereits das alte &#196;gypten "importierte" schwarze Sklaven aus dem heutigen Sudan (Nubien). Die Griechen beschafften sich ihre Sklaven vor allem aus Thrakien und Kleinasien (hier vor allem aus Phrygien und Karien), die R&#246;mer sp&#228;ter vor allem aus Griechenland, vom Balkan und aus Gallien. Im Allgemeinen war es &#252;blich, dass versklavte Mitb&#252;rger sowohl bei den R&#246;mern als auch schon zuvor bei den Griechen vermieden werden sollten. So verkaufte man beispielsweise in Athen in die Schuldknechtschaft geratene B&#252;rger in andere St&#228;dte. Das Zw&#246;lftafelgesetz schrieb den R&#246;mern den Verkauf solcher Personen in ein Gebiet jenseits des Tibers vor. Zentren des antiken Sklavenhandels waren Delos und Ephesos.
Der Sklavenhandel an sich war genau geregelt. Bei Platon sind Regeln &#252;berliefert, wann ein Sklavenkauf r&#252;ckg&#228;ngig gemacht werden konnte. R&#246;mische Sklavenh&#228;ndler mussten Krankheiten und etwaige Verfehlungen eines zum Verkauf stehenden Sklaven angeben. Im Allgemeinen verlief ein Handel f&#252;r einen Sklaven unw&#252;rdig, da er den potentiellen K&#228;ufern nackt pr&#228;sentiert wurde. Aus &#196;gypten sind Kaufvertr&#228;ge &#252;berliefert. Ob die Preise f&#252;r Sklaven hoch oder niedrig waren, ist in der Forschung umstritten. Das hat mehrere Gr&#252;nde. Zum einen ist es heute schwer festzulegen, was ein Mensch wert ist. Zum anderen variierten die Preise f&#252;r Sklaven je nach Region, Zeit und Qualifikation recht stark. F&#252;r manche Zeiten und Orte hat die Forschung anhand verschiedener Quellen versucht, die Marktpreise zu rekonstruieren, was jedoch immer mit sehr gro&#223;en Ungenauigkeiten verbunden ist.
Sklavenhandel war in der Antike ein nicht zu untersch&#228;tzender, aber auch nicht zu &#252;berbewertender Wirtschaftsfaktor. Vor allem die Landwirtschaft, das Handwerk und das Prostitutionsgewerbe waren auf stetigen Nachschub an Menschenmaterial angewiesen.</German>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_BUILDING_BATH_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB] Public bathing has a long history. Although the ancient Greek men practiced nudity in the Gymnasium, it was not acceptable for the women to view the men naked nor for the women to participate in social nudity, even among themselves. Even the original, nude Olympic games were only attended by men.
[TAB] During the Ottoman Empire, public baths, inherited from Byzantium, were widely used. The baths had both a religious and popular origin deriving from the Qur'an (ablution ritual) and the use of steamrooms by the Turks and the Mongols.
[TAB] In The Book of the Bath, Fran&#231;oise de Bonneville wrote, "The history of public baths begins in Greece in the sixth century B.C.," where men and women washed in basins near places of exercise, physical and intellectual. Later gymnasia had indoor basins set overhead, the open maws of marble lions offering showers, and circular pools with tiers of steps for lounging. Bathing was ritualized, becoming an art -- of cleansing sands, hot water, hot air in dark vaulted "vapor baths," a cooling plunge, a rubdown with aromatic oils. Cities all over Ancient Greece honored sites where "young ephebes stood and splashed water over their bodies."
[TAB] Romans adopted this Greek model of "warmth and conviviality," albeit with their usual excess. The first public thermae of 19 BC had a rotunda 25 meters across, circled by small rooms, set in a park with artificial river and pool. By 300 AD the Baths of Diocletian would cover 1.5 million square feet (140,000 m&#178;), its soaring granite and porphry sheltering 3,000 bathers a day. Roman baths became "something like a cross between an aquacentre and a theme park," with pools, game rooms, gardens, even libraries and theatres. The largest baths in Rome were the Baths of Caracalla built by the emperor Caracalla (211-217), where men and women had mixed freely. Laws were soon brought to suppress "licentiousness" (mixed and otherwise). Few worked. In 320 AD women were barred from the thermae. At the end of that century St John Chrysostom, Patriarch of Constantinople, banned baths altogether.
[TAB] In medieval Europe, the Roman custom of public bathing was maintained in some form through bath houses. These became vital community centers, important for gossip and business. Bath houses were unisex. In the film "The Hour of the Pig" (a.k.a. "The Advocate") with Colin Firth, about the life of a rural litigator in medieval France, women and men can be seen mixing freely. In the film women give the Advocate and his friend the priest massages, and it is tacitly understood that these women are prostitutes, able to offer more services than this. Bath houses were sometimes legitimate, and sometimes quasi-legitimate, conjoined with the offices of a brothel, hosting rooms for entertaining, banqueting, and purchasing and enjoying sexual services. This was not always limited to men cavorting with female attendants, one French court case charges a female brothel owner with seducing the premiere women of the town to while their days away banqueting with and enjoying the pleasures of lower class men, who may or may not have been paid for these services. Bath houses were known as 'stews', a word that then remained associated with all brothels, even those not in baths.
[TAB] In Japan, nude communal bathing for men, women, and children at the local public bath, or sento, was a daily fact of life until the mid-1800s and an increase in Western influences. Even though almost all modern day Japanese have their own private baths, public baths are still popular in Japan. Previously, they were invariably unisex, with both sexes, adult and child, utilizing the same bath. This was common until the early 20th century. Nowadays, all public baths have separate facilities for males and females, and many administrative regions require this by law.
[TAB] In modern Russia, much political and economic business is conducted in exclusive men's-only steam baths. It is said that this represents an invisible barrier to women_s attainment of real power in Russia. (Wikipedia)</English>
		<German>[TAB] Im antiken Griechenland und bei den R&#246;mern hatte die Badekultur einen sehr hohen Stellenwert. Den Quellen zufolge badeten die Griechen zun&#228;chst nur kalt in offenen Gew&#228;ssern; warme B&#228;der galten als verweichlichend. So empfahl Platon warme B&#228;der nur f&#252;r Alte und Kranke. Doch schon etwa 2000 Jahre vor unserer Zeitrechnung gab es auf Kreta private Bader&#228;ume und eine Kanalisation.
Griechische &#196;rzte wandten bereits Hydrotherapie an, die sie von den &#196;gyptern &#252;bernommen hatten. Hippokrates war ein bekannter Bef&#252;rworter der Kaltwasserbehandlungen. Er empfahl kalte Wasserg&#252;sse bei Rheuma und Gicht sowie kalte Wickel gegen Fieber.
Au&#223;erdem waren bereits zahlreiche Heilquellen bekannt, von denen viele G&#246;ttern geweiht waren. An besonders wirksamen Quellen wurden so genannte Asklepios-Tempel errichtet, die von Kranken aufgesucht wurden und die im Grunde schon Sanatorien waren. Der ber&#252;hmteste dieser Tempel befand sich in der Stadt Epidauros. Einen sehr guten Ruf hatten auch die hei&#223;en Quellen von Adepsos auf der Insel Eub&#246;a.
Etwa 400 v.Chr. entstanden &#246;ffentliche Badeanstalten mit einem Becken und Wannen sowie einem Salbraum. Oft besa&#223;en auch die hellenistischen Sportanlagen (Gymasien) Wasserbecken zur Abk&#252;hlung nach dem Sport. Da die Athleten sich f&#252;r die Wettk&#228;mpfe mit Sand und &#214;l einrieben wurden Schwei&#223; und Schmutz hinterher mit einem Hautschaber und Wasser entfernt. Zun&#228;chst wurde nur kaltes Wasser benutzt, im Laufe der Zeit dann aber auch warmes. Zur weiteren Reinigung kannten die Griechen Schwitzb&#228;der (Dampfb&#228;der), in denen hei&#223;e Steine mit Wasser &#252;bergossen wurden. Es gab au&#223;erdem trockene Hei&#223;luftb&#228;der. Das waren kleine R&#228;ume, in denen ein Becken mit Holzkohle f&#252;r Hitze sorgte. 300 Jahre sp&#228;ter wurde das so genannte Hypokaustum zur Beheizung der Badeanlagen eingef&#252;hrt.
Die Stoiker kritisierten zwar weiterhin das Bad in warmem Wasser, doch die allgemeine Auffassung hatte sich mittlerweile ge&#228;ndert. Die griechischen Sportst&#228;tten mit integrierten B&#228;dern wurden zu Begegnungsst&#228;tten, in denen man sich stundenlang aufhielt.</German>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_BUILDING_THERMALBAD_ATRIUM_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB] The terms balnea or thermae were the words the ancient Romans used for the buildings housing their public baths.
Most Roman cities had at least one, if not many, such buildings, which were centres of public bathing and socialisation.
Roman bath-houses were also provided for private villas, town houses and forts - these were also called thermae. (Wikipedia)</English>
		<German>[TAB] Die R&#246;mer entwickelten die Badekultur der Griechen weiter. Man sprach dem Bad nicht nur reinigende, sondern auch heilende Wirkung zu. Doch auch bei den R&#246;mern galt warmes Wasser zun&#228;chst als verweichlichend, w&#228;hrend kaltes der Gesundheit der M&#228;nner dienlich sei. Stand die Badekultur zun&#228;chst hinter der sportlichen, vor allem auf die Wehrf&#228;higkeit ausgerichtete K&#246;rperert&#252;chtigung zur&#252;ck, konnte sich der Besuch im Bad seit der fr&#252;hen Kaiserzeit immer mehr gegen den Besuch der Sportanlagen durchsetzen. Demnach wurden die Sportanlagen immer kleiner und die B&#228;der immer gr&#246;&#223;er und pr&#228;chtiger. Seneca badete allj&#228;hrlich am 1. Januar im eiskalten Wasser der Aqua Virgo. Sp&#228;ter nutzte er den weniger kalten Tiber f&#252;r dieses Bad, und im Alter stieg er schlie&#223;lich in eine Badewanne mit lauwarmem Wasser. Das kommentierte er selbst sp&#246;ttisch mit den Worten "Noch ein Schritt weiter, und ich bin beim Schwitzbad angekommen!" [2]
305 v.Chr. besa&#223; Rom die erste gro&#223;e Wasserleitung (Aqua Appia), und zu dieser Zeit wurde bereits ein &#246;ffentliches Bad eingerichtet. Im 4. Jahrhundert gab es allein in Rom zirka 900 &#246;ffentliche B&#228;der. Reiche R&#246;mer besa&#223;en jedoch auch ein eigenes Badezimmer. Die &#246;ffentlichen r&#246;mischen B&#228;der wurden von Angeh&#246;rigen aller Klassen besucht; f&#252;r Arme gab es auch kostenlose Badestuben. In Pompeji sollen Frauen nach den Quellen f&#252;r den Besuch des Bades, obwohl diese kleiner und schlechter ausgestattet waren als die der M&#228;nner, mehr bezahlt haben.
Jedes Badehaus verf&#252;gte &#252;ber Umkleiden, einen Schwitzraum, ein Warmbad, einen m&#228;&#223;ig warmen Raum und ein Kaltbad. Beheizt wurden die Anlagen mit Fu&#223;bodenheizungen. Der Ablauf eines Bades war genau festgelegt. Nach dem Ablegen der Kleider gingen die Besucher in Holzschuhen, mit Badeutensilien und Handtuch zun&#228;chst in den Kaltbaderaum (frigidarium), um sich zu reinigen. Danach folgte ein Warmbaderaum (tepidarium) mit einer Raumtemperatur von 20 bis 25 Grad Celsius, in dem es B&#228;nke und Wasserbecken gab. Hier konnte man sich auch von Bediensteten ein&#246;len und massieren lassen. Es folgte die Nutzung des laconicums mit trockener W&#228;rme oder des feuchthei&#223;en sudatoriums. Der zentrale Raum war das Warmbad (caldarium) mit einer Temperatur von ca. 50 Grad. Wegen der Fu&#223;bodenheizung mussten die Besucher Holzschuhe tragen, um sich nicht die F&#252;&#223;e zu verbrennen. Hier gab es mehrere Gemeinschaftsbecken. Den Abschluss des Bades bildete wieder das Kaltbad mit mehreren Becken.[3]
Die reichen Patrizier kamen mit ihren Sklaven ins Bad. Einer hatte die Garderobe zu bewachen, ein anderer trug die diversen Utensilien, ein dritter schabte ihm mit dem Schabeisen (strigilis) Schwei&#223; und Schmutz von der Haut. Weniger Wohlhabende mussten das selbst erledigen.
Gro&#223;e Badeanlagen verf&#252;gten &#252;ber weitere R&#228;ume wie Sport- und Spielhallen, Gesch&#228;fte und Lokale. Beim Bad in der Antike spielte auch die gesellige Unterhaltung eine gro&#223;e Rolle. In den Thermen von Kaiser Diokletian sollen 3000 Badewannen aus Alabaster gestanden haben sowie 2400 Marmorsessel. Die Thermalb&#228;der des Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa waren rund 14.500 m&#178; gro&#223;; in seinem Testament vermachte er sie dem r&#246;mischen Volk. Sehr bekannt sind auch die Caracalla-Thermen in Rom sowie die Thermen in Pompeji und Trier. Die Kaiser Caligula und Nero leiteten mit gro&#223;em Aufwand Meerwasser durch Aqu&#228;dukte in die B&#228;der. Das letzte r&#246;mische Thermalbad entstand 324 n.Chr. unter Kaiser Konstantin.[4]
Dieses Badewesen breitete sich mit dem r&#246;mischen Einfluss bald in anderen L&#228;ndern aus. Auf deutschem Boden sind u. a. in Trier und in Aachen die &#220;berreste r&#246;mischer B&#228;der zu sehen, auch die Kurorte Baden-Baden und Wiesbaden sind r&#246;mische Gr&#252;ndungen. Die R&#246;mer nutzten zahlreiche Heilquellen innerhalb ihres Herrschaftsbereichs. Der ber&#252;hmteste antike Badeort war Baiae am Golf von Neapel, der u. a. von den Kaisern Caligula, Nero und Hadrian gesch&#228;tzt wurde.
Im Zuge der Belagerung Roms durch die Goten im Jahr 537 wurde das gesamte Wasserleitungssystem zerst&#246;rt, so dass die Thermen nicht mehr betrieben werden konnten.
Mit dem Zerfall des R&#246;mischen Reiches im 5. Jahrhundert setzte im westlichen Europa der Niedergang der B&#228;der ein, w&#228;hrend sie im Byzantinischen Reich erhalten blieben. Alte Thermen wurden weiterbenutzt und neue B&#228;der erbaut. Dies ist umso bemerkenswerter, da zu dieser Zeit in anderen Bereichen beim Bau &#246;ffentlicher Geb&#228;ude ein Niedergang einsetzte. Nach der Eroberung von Alexandria im Jahre 642 berichtet Amr ibn al-As voller Verwunderung, dass die Stadt 4000 Villen mit 4000 B&#228;dern habe. Die von den Arabern vorgefundene Badekultur wurde von ihnen &#252;bernommen, aber modifiziert.

		<English>[TAB] Sento is a type of Japanese communal bath house where customers pay for entrance. Traditionally these bath houses have been quite utilitarian, with one large room separating the sexes by a tall barrier, and on both sides, usually a minimum of lined up faucets and a single large bath for the already washed bathers to sit in among others. Since the second half of the 20th century, these communal bath houses have been decreasing in numbers as more and more Japanese residences now have bathrooms. Some Japanese find social importance in going to public baths, out of the theory that physical proximity/intimacy brings emotional intimacy, which is termed skinship in Japanese. Others go to a sento because they live in a small housing facility without a private bath or to enjoy bathing in a spacious room and to relax in saunas or jet baths that often accompany new or renovated sentos.

		<English>[TAB]A temazcal is a type of sweat lodge which originated with pre-Hispanic Indigenous peoples in Mesoamerica. The word temazcal comes from the Nahuatl word tem&#257;zcalli ("house of heat"), or possibly from the Aztec teme (to bathe) and calli (house). 
In ancient Mesoamerica it was used as part of a curative ceremony thought to purify the body after exertion such as after a battle or a ceremonial ball game. It was also used for healing the sick, improving health, and for women to give birth. It continues to be used today in Indigenous cultures of Mexico and Central America that were part of the ancient Mesoamerican region for spiritual and health reasons. It is currently being recovered by all sectors of society in Mexico and Central America and is used as a cleansing of mind, body and spirit.
The temazcal is usually a permanent structure, unlike sweat lodges in other regions. It is usually constructed from volcanic rock and cement and is usually a circular dome, although rectangular ones have been found at certain archeological sites and this shape is also used. To produce the heat, volcanic stones are heated. Volcanic stones are safe because they do not explode from the temperature. They are then placed in a pit located in the center or near a wall of the temazcal. (Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] Abu Simbel is an archaeological site comprising two massive rock temples in southern Egypt on the western bank of Lake Nasser about 290 km southwest of Aswan. It is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the "Nubian Monuments", which run from Abu Simbel downriver to Philae (near Aswan).
The twin temples were originally carved out of the mountainside during the reign of Pharaoh Ramesses II in the 13th century BC, as a lasting monument to himself and his queen Nefertari, to commemorate his alleged victory at the Battle of Kadesh, and to intimidate his Nubian neighbors. However, the complex was relocated in its entirety in the 1960s, on an artificial hill made from a domed structure, high above the Aswan dam reservoir.
The relocation of the temples was necessary to avoid being submerged during the creation of Lake Nasser, the massive artificial water reservoir formed after the building of the Aswan dam on the Nile River. Abu Simbel remains one of Egypt's top tourist attractions. (Wikipedia)</English>
		<German>[TAB]Bekannt wurde Abu Simbel durch zwei Felsentempel des Pharao Ramses II. am westlichen Nilufer, zwischen dem ersten und zweiten Katarakt. Seit zwei Jahrhunderten sind diese Tempel das Ziel von Touristen aus allen L&#228;ndern. Entdeckt und freigelegt wurde er 1816 von Belzoni welcher im Auftrag von Henry Salt unterwegs war.
Beim Bau des Assuan-Hochdamms drohten beide Tempel in den Fluten des Nassersees zu versinken. Daher wurden sie zwischen 1964 und 1968, unter Leitung von Ingenieuren des deutschen Bauunternehmens Hochtief, in 1.036 Einzelteile zerschnitten und anschlie&#223;end 180 m landeinw&#228;rts sowie 64 m &#252;ber dem alten Standort wieder aufgebaut. Gest&#252;tzt wird dieses Monument nun durch eine Betonkonstruktion. Abu Simbel z&#228;hlt zum UNESCO-Weltkulturerbe.
Durch den neuen Stausee wurde ganz Unternubien &#252;berflutet, die Bewohner wurden heimatlos und zu gro&#223;en Teilen in den Bereich Assuan und Kom Ombo umgesiedelt. Einzig in Abu Simbel entstand ein neuer Ort mit Hotel und Flugplatz. Aufgrund des fehlenden Fruchtlandes lebt die gesamte Bev&#246;lkerung heute vom Tourismus.

		<English>[TAB] The Terracotta Army or Terracotta Warriors and Horses is a collection of 8,099 life-size terra cotta figures of warriors and horses located near the Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor. The figures were discovered in 1974 near Xi'an, Shaanxi province.
The terracotta Army was buried with the first Emperor of Qin (Qin Shi Huangdi) in 210-209 BC. Their purpose was to help rule another empire with Shi Huangdi in the afterlife. Consequently, they are also sometimes referred to as "Qin's Armies".
The Terracotta Army was discovered in March 1974 by local farmers drilling a water well to the east of Mount Lishan. Mount Lishan is the name of the man-made necropolis of the First Emperor of the Qin Dynasty; [Qin Shi Huangdi]. This is also where the material to make the terracotta warriors was made, and found. Construction of this mausoleum began in 246 BC and is believed to have taken 700,000 workers and craftsmen 38 years to complete. Qin Shi Huangdi was interred inside the tomb complex upon his death in 210 BC. According to the Grand Historian Sima Qian, the First Emperor was buried alongside great amounts of treasure and objects of craftsmanship, as well as a scale replica of the universe complete with gemmed ceilings representing the cosmos, and flowing mercury representing the great earthly bodies of water. Pearls were also placed on the ceilings in the tomb to represent the stars, planets, etc. Recent scientific work at the site has shown high levels of mercury in the soil of Mount Lishan, tentatively indicating an accurate description of the site_s contents by Sima Qian.
The tomb of Qin Shi Huangdi is near an earthen pyramid 76 meters tall and nearly 350 meters square. The tomb presently remains unopened and unfound. There are plans to seal off the area around the tomb with a special tent-type structure to prevent corrosion from exposure to outside air. However, there is at present only one company in the world that makes these tents, and their largest model will not cover the site as needed.
Qin Shi Huangdi_s necropolis complex was constructed to serve as an imperial compound or palace. It comprises several offices, halls and other structures and is surrounded by a wall with gateway entrances. The remains of the craftsmen working in the tomb may also be found within its confines, as it is believed they were sealed inside alive to keep them from divulging any secrets about its riches or entrance. It was only fitting, therefore, to have this compound protected by the massive terracotta army interred nearby.	(Wikipedia)</English>

Chr., welche f&#252;r den ersten chinesischen Kaiser Q&#237;n Shihu&#225;ngd&#236; erbaut wurde. Es ist einer der gr&#246;&#223;ten Grabbauten der Welt. Die Terrakottaarmee, welche sich auf drei Gruben verteilt, besteht aus knapp 7.278 lebensgro&#223;en Soldaten (Fu&#223;- und Reitsoldaten), denen Pferde und Kriegswagen und echte Waffen (Schwerter, Pfeilspitzen, Armbr&#252;ste) beigegeben sind. Es handelt sich um die Darstellung einer vollst&#228;ndigen Armee der damaligen Zeit. Die verschiedenen R&#228;nge sind an unterschiedlichen Uniformen erkennbar.
In der Hauptgrube sind die Soldaten in einer Schlachtordnung aufgestellt. Die ersten drei Reihen (204 Bogensch&#252;tzen) bilden die Vorhut. Dahinter folgt die Hauptarmee, welche aus wahrscheinlich 6.000 Soldaten besteht. Da nicht die ganze Grube ausgegraben wurde, kann man die Gesamtzahl nur anhand der "Figurendichte" der bereits ausgegrabenen Soldaten sch&#228;tzen. Diese Hauptarmee wird links und rechts von der Flankendeckung abgesichert. Am Ende folgt die Nachhut.
In der zweiten Grube befinden sich Infanteristen, Reiter und Streitwagen. In der dritten Grube fand man weitere Figuren, welche man aufgrund der Aufstellung und Ausstattung (zum Beispiel Zeremonialwaffen) der Soldaten als Kommandostab identifizierte.
Bemerkenswert ist, dass alle diese Figuren individuell gestaltet sind, also keine zwei in Haltung, Gesichtsz&#252;gen oder Ausstattungsdetails identisch sind. Offen ist die Frage, ob tats&#228;chliche Soldaten von damals nachgebildet wurden oder ob die Erschaffer die unterschiedlichen Figuren frei gestalteten.

		<English>[TAB] Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the USSR (Russian: Piatiletka) were a series of nation-wide centralized exercises in rapid economic development in the Soviet Union. The plans were developed by the Gosplan based on the Theory of Productive Forces that was part of the general guidelines of the Communist Party for economic development. Fulfilling the plan became the watchword of Soviet bureaucracy.
The same method of planning was also adopted by most other communist states, including India's pro-Soviet government and the People's Republic of China in the 1950_60s. In addition, several capitalist states have emulated the concept of central planning, though in the context of a market economy, by setting integrated economic goals for a finite period of time. Thus are found "Seven-year Plans" and "Twelve-Year Plans".
Several five-year plans did not take up the full period of time assigned to them (some were successfully completed earlier than expected, while others failed and were abandoned). The initial five-year plans were created to serve in the rapid industrialization of the Soviet Union, and thus placed a major focus on heavy industry. Altogether, there were 13 five-year plans. The first one was accepted in 1928, for the five year period from 1929 to 1933, and completed one year early. The last, thirteenth Five-Year Plan was for the period from 1991 to 1995 and was not completed, as the Soviet Union was dissolved in 1991. (Wikipedia)</English>

F&#252;nfjahrplan der Sowjetunion w&#228;hrte von 1985 bis 1990, der nachfolgende 13. F&#252;nfjahrplan wurde bereits 1991 wegen der Aufl&#246;sung der Sowjetunion vorzeitig beendet.
Nach einem Zweijahresplan (1949-1950) setzte man in der DDR auf den F&#252;nfjahresplan. Nach dem ersten (1951-1955) und zweitem (ab 1958) F&#252;nfjahrplan wollte man 1959 den Siebenjahrplan einf&#252;hren, der jedoch nur bis 1963 dauern sollte und von 1963 bis 1970 als Perspektivplan galt und in einzelnen Jahrspl&#228;nen konkretisiert wurde.
Auch die Volksrepublik China strukturierte ihre Wirtschaftsplanung in F&#252;nfjahrespl&#228;nen.
F&#252;nfjahrpl&#228;ne wurden von der Staatlichen Plankommission aufgestellt und enthielten Zuweisungen von Fonds bzw.

		<English>[TAB] The tomb of King Mausollos of Caria (from whose name the generic term "mausoleum" derives), a local Persian ruler, was not especially remarkable in its construction or size. Its status as one of the Ancient Wonders of the World comes from the dozens of painstakingly carved statues and sculptures that surrounded it. They depicted legendary and real people, and the noble animals of mythology and history. Inside the mausoleum was a great frieze, or wall-carving, depicting an epic battle between the Greeks and the Amazons, and topping the mausoleum's dome was a huge statue of a four-horse chariot. The Mausoleum and its statues survived until after the Crusades, when Christian knights founded a new crusader kingdom in Asia Minor, and used the already-carved stones of the Mausoleum to build castles. The statues, in turn, spread around the world, until British archaeologists began to collect and recover them. Some can be seen today in museums, but most have been lost or destroyed. -Civ3 </English>

		<English>[TAB] ITER (originally an acronym of International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor and Latin for the way or the road) is an international nuclear fusion research and engineering project, which is currently building the world's largest experimental tokamak nuclear fusion reactor at the Cadarache facility in the south of France. The ITER project aims to make the long-awaited transition from experimental studies of plasma physics to full-scale electricity-producing fusion power plants. The project is funded and run by seven member entities - the European Union (EU), India, Japan, China, Russia, South Korea and the United States. The EU, as host party for the ITER complex, is contributing 45% of the cost, with the other six parties contributing 9% each.
The ITER fusion reactor itself has been designed to produce 500 megawatts of output power for 50 megawatts of input power, or ten times the amount of energy put in. The machine is expected to demonstrate the principle of producing more energy from the fusion process than is used to initiate it, something that has not yet been achieved with previous fusion reactors. Construction of the facility began in 2007, and the first plasma is expected to be produced in 2020. When ITER becomes operational, it will become the largest magnetic confinement plasma physics experiment in use, surpassing the Joint European Torus. The first commercial demonstration fusion power plant, named DEMO, is proposed to follow on from the ITER project to bring fusion energy to the commercial market. (Wikipedia) </English>
		<German>[TAB] Der Begriff Kalte Fusion geht auf einen Vorschlag Andrei Sacharows von 1948 zur&#252;ck und beschreibt urspr&#252;nglich die (funktionierende, aber ineffiziente) myonenkatalysierte Kernfusion. Bei dieser wird das Elektron eines Tritiumatoms durch ein Myon ersetzt. Aufgrund der drastisch geringeren Orbitalgr&#246;&#223;e kann das Tritiumatom damit nahe genug an ein Deuteriumatom gelangen, um zu fusionieren. Das Myon wird anschlie&#223;end wieder freigesetzt und kann weitere Fusionen einleiten. Allerdings werden pro eingesetztem Myon nur etwa 2 MeV frei, da es nur eine Lebensdauer von 2,2 Mikrosekunden hat, w&#228;hrend die Herstellung in Teilchenbeschleunigern &#252;ber 3 MeV pro Myon erfordert, sodass auf diese Weise bisher kein Fusionsreaktor zur Energieerzeugung m&#246;glich ist. Heute wird unter dem Begriff Kalte Fusion allerdings meist das 1989 von den Chemikern Stanley Pons und Martin Fleischmann vorgestellte Experiment und verwandte Methoden verstanden. In diesem Experiment soll die Verschmelzung von Wasserstoff (Protium), Deuterium oder Tritium w&#228;hrend der Elektrolyse eines Elektrolyt an der Oberfl&#228;che einer von zwei Palladium-Elektroden stattfinden. Die Idee des Versuchs besteht darin, dass Wasserstoff, bzw. eines der Isotope (Deuterium, Tritium) in das Metallgitter des Palladiums diffundiert. Die Elektronen des Wasserstoffs werden durch die Umgebung des Metalls delokalisiert, dass hei&#223;t in einem gr&#246;&#223;eren Raumbereich um das urspr&#252;ngliche Atom verteilt. Die r&#252;ckstossende Wirkung der &#228;u&#223;eren Elektronenh&#252;lle, welche die erste Barriere f&#252;r die Fusion bildet, wird hierdurch entfernt. Befinden sich zwei Wasserstoffatome (bzw. Iostope) im gleichen Zwischenraum des Metallgitters, so ist ihr Abstand zueinander f&#252;r eine lange Zeit erheblich niedriger als in freien Gas bzw. in einem hei&#223;en Plasma. Mit einer gewissen Wahrscheinlichkeit k&#246;nnen diese Kerne unter diesen Bedingungen die absto&#223;ende Wirkung der Kernpotentiale &#252;berwinden und miteinander verschmelzen.

The mosque is one of several mosques known as the Blue Mosque for the blue tiles adorning the walls of its interior. (Wikipedia)</English>
		<German>[TAB] Die Sultan-Ahmet-Moschee (t&#252;rkisch Sultanahmet Camii) in Istanbul wurde 1609 von Sultan Ahmet I. in Auftrag gegeben und bis 1616, ein Jahr vor dem Tod des Sultans, vom Sch&#252;ler Sinans, Mehmet Aga, erbaut. Sie ist heute, nach der S&#228;kularisierung der Hagia Sophia, Istanbuls Hauptmoschee. In Europa kennt man sie als Blaue Moschee wegen ihres Reichtums an blau-wei&#223;en Fliesen, die die Kuppel und den oberen Teil der Mauern zieren, aber j&#252;nger als der Bau selbst sind. Kunsthistorisch bedeutsamer sind die Fliesen auf dem unteren Teil der Mauern und den Trib&#252;nen: Sie stammen aus der Bl&#252;tezeit der Iznik-Fayencen und zeigen traditionelle Pflanzenmotive, bei denen Gr&#252;n und Blaut&#246;ne dominieren. Die Ausmalung des Innenraumes wurde auf Rosa ge&#228;ndert.
Die Moschee ist eines der wenigen islamischen Gottesh&#228;user der Welt mit sechs Minaretten. Nur die Hauptmoschee in Mekka hat eines mehr, das angef&#252;gt wurde, als die Sultan-Ahmet-Moschee sechs erhielt. Gem&#228;&#223; Hofchronisten hatte der Sultan bei der Auftragsvergabe vom Architekten verlangt, die Minarette zu vergolden. Da das aufzuwendende Blattgold aber das ihm vorgegebene Budget vollkommen &#252;berschritten h&#228;tte, "verh&#246;rte" sich Mehmet Aga und machte aus dem t&#252;rkischen Wort altin (_Gold_) die Zahl alti (_sechs_).
Der Gebetsraum ist mit 53 m L&#228;nge und 51 m Breite fast quadratisch. Die Hauptkuppel hat einen Durchmesser von 23,5 m und ist 43 m hoch. Sie wird von vier Spitzb&#246;gen und vier flachen Zwickeln getragen, die wieder auf vier riesigen, 5 m dicken S&#228;ulen ruhen. 260 Fenster erhellen den Innenraum. Die bunten Glasscheiben sind moderne Nachbildungen der urspr&#252;nglichen aus dem 17. Jahrhundert.
Moschee und Hof waren von einer Mauer umgeben. Davon existiert nur mehr der Nordteil. Sie trennt die Moschee von den anderen Geb&#228;uden der K&#252;lliye ab, die es heute noch gibt. In der angrenzenden T&#252;rbe, die f&#252;r die Besucher ge&#246;ffnet ist, ruhen Ahmet I., seine Frau und drei seiner S&#246;hne, Osman II. (1618-1622), Murat IV. und Prinz Beyazit.
Im oberen Teil des Hofeingangs auf der Westseite befindet sich eine schwere Eisenkette. Diese diente dazu, dass der Sultan, der den Hof zu Pferde betrat, an dieser Stelle seinen Kopf neigen musste, wenn er nicht an die Kette sto&#223;en wollte. Dies diente als ein symbolischer Akt, damit der Sultan nicht erhobenen Hauptes, also in der Pose vollen Stolzes, die Moschee betreten konnte. (Wikipedia)</German>

The mechanism inside the tower is known as a turret clock. It often marks the hour (and sometimes segments of an hour) by sounding large bells or chimes, sometimes playing simple musical phrases or tunes.
Although clock towers are today mostly admired for their aesthetics, they once served an important purpose. Before the middle of the twentieth century, most people did not have watches; clock towers were therefore placed near the centers of towns and were often the tallest structures there. The use of clock towers in the West date back to the ancient Roman period, while other civilizations such as medieval China also featured clock towers (see Su Song).
Some clock towers are famous landmarks. Three of the best-known are the clock tower which houses Big Ben (often itself colloquially referred to as Big Ben) of the Palace of Westminster in London, the Rajabai Tower in Mumbai, and the Spasskaya Tower of the Moscow Kremlin.
On New Year's Eve 2004 four 6.3-metre clock faces were added to the top of the Warsaw Palace of Culture and Science building in Warsaw, Poland making it the highest 4-faced clock tower in the world and the second highest clock tower in the world. The NTT DoCoMo Yoyogi Building 240 meters (787 feet) is 10 meters higher and is the highest clock tower in the world. The Allen-Bradley Clock Tower holds the record for largest non-chiming four faced clock. The chimes were intentionally left out so that the Big Ben tower would still have that record.

		<English>[TAB] Natural gas is a major source of electricity generation through the use of gas turbines and steam turbines. Particularly high efficiencies can be achieved through combining gas turbines with a steam turbine in combined cycle mode. Natural gas burns cleaner than other fossil fuels, such as oil and coal, and produces less greenhouse gas per unit energy released. For an equivalent amount of heat, burning natural gas produces about 30% less carbon dioxide than burning petroleum and about 45% less than burning coal.

		<German>[TAB] Natural gas is a major source of electricity generation through the use of gas turbines and steam turbines. Particularly high efficiencies can be achieved through combining gas turbines with a steam turbine in combined cycle mode. Natural gas burns cleaner than other fossil fuels, such as oil and coal, and produces less greenhouse gas per unit energy released. For an equivalent amount of heat, burning natural gas produces about 30% less carbon dioxide than burning petroleum and about 45% less than burning coal. Combined cycle power generation using natural gas is thus the cleanest source of power available using fossil fuels, and this technology is widely used wherever gas can be obtained at a reasonable cost. Fuel cell technology may eventually provide cleaner options for converting natural gas into electricity, but as yet it is not price-competitive.

		<English>[TAB] An arsenal is an establishment for the construction, repair, storage and issue of weapons and ammunition. The word arsenal appears in various forms in Romanic languages (from which it has been adopted into Teutonic), i.e. Italian arzanale, Spanish arsenal, etc.; Italian also has arzana and darsena, and Spanish a longer form atarazanal. The word is of Arabic origin, being a corruption of daras-sina'ah, house of trade or manufacture, dar, house, al, the, and sina'ah, trade, manufacture (with jana'a, to make). Such guesses as arx navalis, naval citadel, arx senatus (i.e. of Venice, etc.), have been discounted. For the rest of Early Modern Europe, the Arsenal was the Venetian Arsenal.
A first-class arsenal, which can renew the materiel and equipment of a large army, embraces a gun factory, carriage factory, laboratory and small-arms ammunition factory, small-arms factory, harness, saddlery and tent factories, and a powder factory; in addition it must possess great store-houses. In a second-class arsenal the factories would be replaced by workshops. The situation of an arsenal should be governed by strategic considerations. If of the first class, it should be situated at the base of operations and supply, secure from attack, not too near a frontier, and placed so as to draw in readily the resources of the country. The importance of a large arsenal is such that its defences would be on the scale of those of a large fortress.
The usual subdivision of branches in a great arsenal is into A, Storekeeping; B, Construction; C, Administration. Under A we should have the following departments and stores: Departments of issue and receipt, pattern room, armoury department, ordnance or park, harness, saddlery and accoutrements, camp equipment, tools and instruments, engineer store, timber yard, braking-up store, unserviceable store. Under B: Gun factory, carriage factory, laboratory, small-arms factory, harness and tent factory, powder factory, etc. In a second- class arsenal there would be workshops instead of these factories. C: Under the head of administration would be classed the chief director of the arsenal, officials military and civil, non-commissioned officers and military artificers, civilian foremen, workmen and laborers, with the clerks and writers necessary for the office work of the establishments.
In the manufacturing branches are required skill, and efficient and economical work, both executive and administrative; in the storekeeping part, good arrangement, great care, thorough knowledge of all warlike stores, both in their active and passive state, and scrupulous exactness in the custody, issue and receipt of stores. Frederick Taylor introduced command and control techniques to arsenals.
In England the Royal Arsenal (also known as the Woolwich Arsenal) manufactured and stored the requirements of the army and navy; some of its workers founded the London football club Arsenal F.C.. (Wikipedia)</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_BUILDING_GLASSWORK_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB] Glassblowing was invented by Syrian craftsmen from Sidon and Babylon between 27 BC and 14 AD. The ancient Romans copied the technique consisting of blowing air into molten glass with a blowpipe making it into a bubble.
Hence, tube blowing not only represents the initial attempts of experimentation by glassworkers at blowing glass, it is also a revolutionary step that induced a change in conception and a deep understanding of glass. Such inventions swiftly eclipsed all other traditional methods, such as casting and core-forming, in working glass. (Wikipedia)</English>
		<German>[TAB] While the first evidence of man-made glass occurs in Mesopotamia in the Late-Third/Early-Second Millennium B.C., the actual "blowing" of glass using a tube did not occur until sometime in the First century BC in Roman Syria. Glassblowing is a form of art that requires extreme training and an intense level of aptitude. This advancement transformed the material's usefulness from a time-consuming process in which the medium was hot-formed around rough cores of mud and dung into a mass-producible material which could be quickly inflated into large, transparent, and leak-proof vessels. Glassblowing techniques spread throughout the Roman world. Venice, particularly the island of Murano, became a centre for high quality glass manufacture in the late medieval period.
The relatively recent "studio glass movement" began in 1962 when Harvey Littleton, a ceramics professor, and Dominick Labino, a chemist and engineer, held two workshops at the Toledo Museum of Art, during which they began experimenting with melting glass in a small furnace and creating blown glass art. Thus Littleton and Labino are credited with being the first to make molten glass available to artists working in private studios. This approach to glassblowing blossomed into a worldwide movement, producing such flamboyant and prolific artists as Dale Chihuly, Dante Marioni, Fritz Driesbach and Marvin Lipofsky. Lino Tagliapietra was the first Murano-trained artist to leave and spread his knowledge in the United States. In 1971, Dale Chihuly began the Pilchuck Glass School near Stanwood, Washington. The Pilchuck School of Glass became the source of a great deal of the current American Studio Glass movement, and continues as such today.
In addition to glassblowing as an art, many individuals pursue glassblowing as a hobby. In fact, it is one of the fastest growing hobbies in North America. (Wikipedia)</German>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_BUILDING_GAZPROM_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB] PJSC Gazprom is a Russian majority state-owned multinational energy corporation headquartered in the Lakhta Center in Saint Petersburg. As of 2019, with sales over $120 billion, it was ranked as the largest publicly listed natural gas company in the world and the largest company in Russia by revenue. In the 2020 Forbes Global 2000, Gazprom was ranked as the 32nd largest public company in the world. The Gazprom name is a contraction of the Russian words gazovaya promyshlennost (gas industry). In January 2022, Gazprom displaced Sberbank from the first place in the list of the largest companies in Russia by market capitalization. 
[TAB] Gazprom is vertically integrated and is active in every area of the gas industry, including exploration and production, refining, transport, distribution and marketing, and power generation. In 2018, Gazprom produced twelve percent of the global output of natural gas, producing 497.6 billion cubic meters of natural and associated gas and 15.9 million tonnes of gas condensate. Gazprom then exports the gas through pipelines that the company builds and owns across Russia and abroad such as Nord Stream 1 and TurkStream. In the same year, Gazprom has proven reserves of 35.1 trillion cubic meters of gas and 1.6 billion tons of gas condensate. Gazprom is also a large oil producer through its subsidiary Gazprom Neft, producing about 41 million tons of oil with reserves amounting to 2 billion tons. The company also has subsidiaries in industrial sectors including finance, media and aviation, and majority stakes in other companies.
[TAB] Repeatedly, Gazprom has been accused of being a political and economical weapon of Russia, using the supply and price of natural gas to gain control over Europe and most noteworthy, Ukraine. "Regardless of how the stand-off over Ukraine develops, one lesson is clear: excessive dependence on Russian energy makes Europe weak," said Donald Tusk, former prime minister of Poland in April 2014. The friction resulted in two boycott campaigns in Ukraine, one that started in 2005, the other in 2013. Russia denies weaponizing energy via Gazprom. In December 2019, Gazprom paid $2.9 billion to Ukrainian counterpart Naftogaz as ordered by a Stockholm court ruling's award on damage claims stemming from alleged economical harassment. In the wake of the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine Gazprom had issues with many EU countries, and stated it would cut off supplies to French energy supplier, Engie, over failure to pay in full for deliveries. This was disputed, with France's Energy Transition Minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher stating, "Very clearly Russia is using gas as a weapon of war and we must prepare for the worst case scenario of a complete interruption of supplies."(Wikipedia)</English>
		<German>[TAB] Gazprom is the largest Russian company and the biggest extractor of natural gas in the world. With sales of US$ 31 billion in 2004, it accounts for about 93% of Russian natural gas production and with reserves of 28,800 km&#179;, it controls 16% of the world's gas reserves (as of 2004, including the Shtokman field.) After acquisition of the oil company Sibneft, Gazprom, with 119 billion barrels of reserves, ranks behind only Saudi Arabia, with 263 billion barrels, and Iran, with 133 billion barrels, as the world's biggest owner of oil and oil equivalent in natural gas.
By the end of 2004 Gazprom was the sole gas supplier to at least Bosnia-Herzegovina, Estonia, Finland, Macedonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova and Slovakia, and provided 97 percent of Bulgaria's gas, 89 percent of Hungary's, 86 percent of Poland's, nearly three-quarters of the Czech Republic's, 67 percent of Turkey's, 65 percent of Austria's, about 40 percent of Romania's, 36 percent of Germany's, 27 percent of Italy's, and 25 percent of France's. The European Union gets about 25% of its gas supplies from this company.
Apart from its gas reserves and the world's longest pipeline network with 150,000 km, it also controls assets in banking, insurance, media, construction and agriculture.
With over US$ 300 billion of market capitalization (as of June 2007), Gazprom is the world's third largest corporation following this measure. (Wikipedia)</German>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_BUILDING_BLETCHLEY_PARK_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB] Bletchley Park, also known as Station X, is an estate located in the town of Bletchley, now part of Milton Keynes, England. During World War II, Bletchley Park was the location of the United Kingdom's main codebreaking establishment. Codes and ciphers of several Axis countries were deciphered there, most famously the German Enigma. The high-level intelligence produced by Bletchley Park, codenamed Ultra, is frequently credited with aiding the Allied war effort and shortening the war, although Ultra's effect on the actual outcome of WWII is debated.
		Just before war broke out Biuro Szyfr&#243;w revealed Poland's achievements on decrypting German Enigma codes to British intelligence. The British used the information given to them by Poland as a basis for their own attempts to decrypt German Enigma signals. The "first wave" of the Government Code and Cypher School moved to Bletchley Park on 15 August 1939. The main body of GC and CS, including its Naval, Military and Air Sections was on the ground floor of the house, together with a telephone exchange, a teleprinter room, a kitchen and a dining room for all the staff. The top floor was allocated to MI6. The prefabricated wooden huts were still being erected, and initially the entire shooting party was crowded into the existing house, its stables and cottages. These were too small, so Elmers School, a neighbouring boys' boarding school was acquired for the Commercial and Diplomatic Sections (Smith, 1998 page 2-3).
A wireless room was set up in the mansion's water tower and given the code name "Station X",a term now sometimes applied to the codebreaking efforts at Bletchley as a whole. Due to the long radio aerials stretching from the wireless room, the radio station was soon moved away from Bletchley Park, in order to not draw attention to the site.
Listening stations - the "Y" Stations (such as the ones at Chicksands and Beaumanor Hall, the War Office "Y" Group HQ) - gathered raw signals for processing at Bletchley. Coded messages were taken down by hand and sent to Bletchley on paper by motorcycle couriers or, later, by teleprinter. Bletchley Park is mainly remembered for breaking messages enciphered on the German Enigma cypher machine, but its greatest cryptographic achievement may have been the breaking of the German "Fish" High Command teleprinter cyphers.
The intelligence produced from decrypts at Bletchley was code-named "ULTRA". It contributed greatly to the Allied success in defeating the U-boats in the Battle of the Atlantic, and to the British naval victories of Battle of Cape Matapanand the Battle of North Cape.
When the United States joined the war Churchill agreed with Roosevelt to pool resources and a number of American cryptographers were posted to Bletchley Park. Whilst the British continued to work on German cyphers, the Americans concentrated on the Japanese ones.
The only direct action that the site experienced was when three bombs, thought to have been intended for Bletchley railway station, were dropped on 20-21 Nov 1940. One bomb exploded next to the dispatch riders' entrance, shifting the whole of Hut 4 (the Naval Intelligence hut) two feet on its base. As the huts stood on brick pillars, engineers just winched it back into position whilst work continued inside.
An outpost of Bletchley Park was set up at Kilindini, Kenya to break and decipher Japanese codes. With a mixture of skill and good fortune, this was successfully done: the Japanese merchant marine suffered 90 per cent losses by August 1945, a result of decrypts.
Bletchley Park is now a museum and is open to the public. (Wikipedia)</English>

Stories have probably been shared in every culture and in every land as a means of entertainment, education, preservation of culture and to instill knowledge and values/morals. Crucial elements of storytelling include plot and characters, as well as the narrative point of view. Stories are frequently used to teach, explain, and/or entertain. Less frequently, but occasionally with major consequences, they have been used to mislead. There can be much truth in a story of fiction, and much falsehood in a story that uses facts.
People in all times and places have told stories. In the oral tradition, storytelling includes the teller and the audience. The storyteller creates the experience, while the audience perceives the message and creates personal mental images from the words heard and the gestures seen. In this experience, the audience becomes co-creator of the art. Storytellers sometimes dialogue with their audience, adjusting their words to respond to the listeners and to the moment.
Oral storytelling is an improvisational art form, one that is sometimes compared to music. Generally, a storyteller does not memorize a set text, but learns a series of script-like incidents that form a satisfying narrative arc (a plot) with a distinct beginning, middle and end. The teller visualizes the characters and settings, and then improvises the actual wording. Thus no two tellings of an oral story are exactly alike. (Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] A warehouse can be defined functionally as a building in which to store bulk produce or goods (wares) for commercial purposes. The built form of warehouse structures throughout time depends on many contexts: materials, technologies, sites, and cultures.
[TAB] In this sense, the warehouse postdates the need for communal or state-based mass storage of surplus food. Prehistoric civilizations relied on family- or community-owned storage pits, or 'palace' storerooms, such as at Knossos, to protect surplus food. The archaeologist Colin Renfrew argued that gathering and storing agricultural surpluses in Bronze Age Minoan 'palaces' was a critical ingredient in the formation of proto-state power.
[TAB] The need for warehouses developed in societies in which trade reached a critical mass requiring storage at some point in the exchange process. This was highly evident in ancient Rome, where the horreum (pl. horrea) became a standard building form. The most studied examples are in Ostia, the port city that served Rome. The Horrea Galbae, a warehouse complex on the road towards Ostia, demonstrates that these buildings could be substantial, even by modern standards. (Wikipedia)</English>

Meats and fish are the most common smoked foods, though cheeses, vegetables, and ingredients used to make beverages such as whisky,Rauchbier, and lapsang souchong tea are also smoked.
In Europe, alderwood is the traditional smoking wood, but oak is more often used now, and beech to a lesser extent. In North America, hickory, mesquite, oak, pecan, alder, maple, and fruit-tree woods such as apple, cherry and plum are commonly used for smoking. Other fuels besides wood can also be employed, sometimes with the addition of flavoring ingredients. Chinese tea-smoking uses a mixture of uncooked rice, sugar, and tea, heated at the base of a wok. Some North American ham and bacon makers smoke their products over burning corn cobs. Peat is burned to dry and smoke the barley malt used to make whisky and some beers.
Historically, farms in the western world included a small building termed the smokehouse where meats could be smoked and stored. This was generally well-separated from other buildings both because of the fire danger and because of the smoke emanations. The buccan is a smoking device used by some Native Americans.

		<German>[TAB] Smoking is the process of flavoring, cooking, or preserving food by exposing it to the smoke from burning or smoldering plant materials, most often wood. Meats and fish are the most common smoked foods, though cheeses, vegetables, and ingredients used to make beverages such as whisky,Rauchbier, and lapsang souchong tea are also smoked.

		<English>[TAB] Fertilizers (also spelled fertilisers) are compounds given to plants to promote growth; they are usually applied either via the soil, for uptake by plant roots, or by foliar feeding, for uptake through leaves. Fertilizers can be organic (composed of organic matter), or inorganic (made of simple, inorganic chemicals or minerals). They can be naturally occurring compounds such as peat or mineral deposits, or manufactured through natural processes (such as composting) or chemical processes (such as the Haber process).
Fertilizers typically provide, in varying proportions, the three major plant nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium), the secondary plant nutrients (calcium, sulfur, magnesium), and sometimes trace elements (or micronutrients) with a role in plant nutrition: boron, chlorine, manganese, iron, zinc, copper, and molybdenum.
The Englishmen James Fison, Edward Packard, Thomas Hadfield and the Prentice brothers each founded companies in the early 19th centiury to create fertilizers from bonemeal. The developing sciences of chemistry and Paleontology, combined with the discovery of coprolites in commercial quantities in East Anglia, led Fisons and Packard to develop sulfuric acid and fertilizer plants at Bramford, and Snape, Suffolk in the 1850s to create superphosphates, which were shipped around the world from the port at Ipswich. After World War I their businesses came under financial pressure as the extraction and distribution of guano, primarily found on the Pacific islands, had become economic.
The interwar period saw innovative competition from Imperial Chemical Industries who developed synthetic ammonium sulfate in 1923, Nitro-chalk in 1927, and a more concentrated and economical fertilzer called CCF based on ammonium phosphate in 1931. Competition was limited as ICI ensured it controlled most of the world's ammonium sulfate supplies. Other European and North American fertilizer companies developed their market share, and the pioneers ultimately merged as Fisons, Packard, and Prentice Ltd. in 1929. By World War II they had acquired about 40 companies, including Hadfields in 1935, and two years later the large Anglo-Continental Guano Works, founded in 1917. (Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] At the end of World War II, competing Russian, British, and U.S. military and scientific crews raced to capture technology and trained personnel from the German rocket program at Peenem&#252;nde. Russia and Britain had some success, but the United States benefited most. The US captured a large number of German rocket scientists (many of whom were members of the Nazi Party, including von Braun) and brought them to the United States as part of Operation Paperclip. There the same rockets that were designed to rain down on Britain were used instead by scientists as research vehicles for developing the new technology further. The V-2 evolved into the American Redstone rocket, used in the early space program.
After the war, rockets were used to study high-altitude conditions, by radio telemetry of temperature and pressure of the atmosphere, detection of cosmic rays, and further research; notably for the Bell X-1 to break the sound barrier. This continued in the U.S. under von Braun and the others, who were destined to become part of the U.S. scientific complex.
Independently, research continued in the Soviet Union under the leadership of Sergei Korolev. With the help of German technicians, the V-2 was duplicated and improved as the R-1, R-2 and R-5 missiles. German designs were abandoned in the late 1940s, and the foreign workers were sent home. A new series of engines built by Glushko and based on inventions of Aleksei Isaev formed the basis of the first ICBM, the R-7. The R-7 launched the first satellite, the first man into space and the first lunar and planetary probes, and is still in use today. These events attracted the attention of top politicians, along with more money for further research.
Rockets became extremely important militarily in the form of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) when it was realised that nuclear weapons carried on a rocket vehicle were essentially not defensible against once launched, and they became the delivery platform of choice for these weapons.

The V-2 evolved into the American Redstone rocket, used in the early space program.
After the war, rockets were used to study high-altitude conditions, by radio telemetry of temperature and pressure of the atmosphere, detection of cosmic rays, and further research; notably for the Bell X-1 to break the sound barrier. This continued in the U.S. under von Braun and the others, who were destined to become part of the U.S. scientific complex.
Independently, research continued in the Soviet Union under the leadership of Sergei Korolev. With the help of German technicians, the V-2 was duplicated and improved as the R-1, R-2 and R-5 missiles. German designs were abandoned in the late 1940s, and the foreign workers were sent home. A new series of engines built by Glushko and based on inventions of Aleksei Isaev formed the basis of the first ICBM, the R-7. The R-7 launched the first satellite, the first man into space and the first lunar and planetary probes, and is still in use today. These events attracted the attention of top politicians, along with more money for further research.
Rockets became extremely important militarily in the form of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) when it was realised that nuclear weapons carried on a rocket vehicle were essentially not defensible against once launched, and they became the delivery platform of choice for these weapons.

		<English>[TAB] With the establishment of overseas colonies, the British Empire at the end of the 17th century/beginning of the 18th century had a vast source of raw materials and a vast market for goods. The manufacture of goods was performed on a limited scale by individual workers - usually on their own premises (such as weavers' cottages) - and was transported around the country by horse and cart, or by river boat. Power was supplied by draught animals for agriculture and haulage.
There was a marketplace to service, but the scale of industry; the sources of energy; and the lack of an inland communications infrastructure were the unseen hurdles to overcome.
In this context, the scene was set for the Kingdom of Great Britain to develop the industry of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution.
The key British industry at the beginning of the 18th century was the production of textiles made with wool from the large sheep-farming areas in the Midlands and across the country (created as a result of land-clearance and inclosure). Handlooms and spinning wheels were the tools of the trade of the weavers in their cottages, and this was a labour-intensive activity providing employment throughout Britain, with major centres being the West Country; Norwich and environs; and the West Riding of Yorkshire. The export trade in woolen goods accounted for more than a quarter of British exports during most of the 18th century, doubling between 1701 and 1770. Exports of the cotton industry - centred in Lancashire - had grown tenfold during this time, but still accounted for only a tenth of the value of the woollen trade... (Wikipedia)

		<English>[TAB] Retailing consists of the sale of goods or merchandise, from a fixed location such as a department store or kiosk, in small or individual lots for direct consumption by the purchaser. Retailing may include subordinated services, such as delivery. Purchasers may be individuals or businesses. In commerce, a retailer buys goods or products in large quantities from manufacturers or importers, either directly or through a wholesaler, and then sells smaller quantities to the end-user. Retail establishments are often called shops or stores. Retailers are at the end of the supply chain. Manufacturing marketers see the process of retailing as a necessary part of their overall distribution strategy.
Shops may be on residential streets, or in shopping streets with few or no houses, or in a shopping center or mall, but mostly found in the central business district. Shopping streets may or may not be for pedestrians only. Sometimes a shopping street has a partial or full roof to protect customers from precipitation. Retailers often provided boardwalks in front of their stores to protect customers from the mud. Online retailing, also known as e-commerce is the latest form of non-shop retailing.

		<English>[TAB] Agronomy is the science and technology of producing and using plants for food, fuel, fiber, and land reclamation. Agronomy has come to encompass work in the areas of plant genetics, plant physiology, meteorology, and soil science. It is the application of a combination of sciences like biology, chemistry, economics, ecology, earth science, and genetics. With the exception of theoretical agronomy, research in agronomy, more than in any other field, is strongly related to local areas. It can be considered a science of ecoregions, because it is closely linked to soil properties and climate, which are never exactly the same from one place to another. Many people think an agricultural production system relying on local weather, soil characteristics, and specific crops has to be studied locally. 
		Agricultural science began with Gregor Mendel's genetic work, but in modern terms might be better dated from the chemical fertilizer outputs of plant physiological understanding in 18th-century Germany. Chemical materials developed to assist in the production of food, feed, and fiber include scores of herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, and other pesticides, plant growth regulators, fertilizers, and animal feed supplements. Chief among these groups from the commercial point of view are manufactured fertilizers, synthetic pesticides (including herbicides), and supplements for feeds. The latter include both nutritional supplements (for example, mineral nutrients) and medicinal compounds for the prevention or control of disease. Agricultural chemistry often aims at preserving or increasing the fertility of soil, maintaining or improving the agricultural yield, and improving the quality of the crop. (Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] Shipyards and dockyards are places which repair and build ships. These can be yachts, military vessels, cruise liners or other cargo or passenger ships. Dockyards are sometimes more associated with maintenance and basing activities than shipyards, which are sometimes associated more with initial construction. The terms are routinely used interchangeably, in part because the evolution of dockyards and shipyards has often caused them to change or merge roles.
Countries with large ship building industries include South Korea, Japan, China, Germany and Russia. The ship building industry tends to be more fragmented in Europe than in Asia. In European countries there are more smaller companies, compared to the fewer, larger companies in the ship building countries of Asia.
Most ship builders in the United States are privately owned, the largest being Northrop Grumman, a multi-billion dollar defense contractor. The publicly owned shipyards in the US are Naval facilities providing basing, support and repair.
Shipyards are constructed by the sea or by tidal rivers to allow easy access for their ships. In the United Kingdom, for example, shipyards were established on the River Thames (King Henry VIII founded yards at Woolwich and Deptford in 1512 and 1513 respectively), River Mersey, River Tyne, River Wear and River Clyde - the latter growing to be the World's pre-eminent shipbuilding centre. Sir Alfred Yarrow established his yard by the Thames in London's Docklands in the late 19th century before moving it northwards to the banks of the Clyde at Scotstoun (1906-08). Other famous UK shipyards include the Harland and Wolff yard in Belfast, Northern Ireland, where the Titanic was built, and the naval dockyard at Chatham, England on the Medway in north Kent.
The site of a large shipyard will contain many specialised cranes, dry docks, slipways, dust-free warehouses, painting facilities and extremely large areas for fabrication of the ships.
After a ship's useful life is over, it makes its final voyage to a shipbreaking yard, often on a beach in South Asia. Historically shipbreaking was carried on in drydock in developed countries, but high wages and environmental regulations have resulted in movement of the industry to developing regions.

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_BUILDING_RAILSTATION_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB] Rail transport is an energy-efficient and capital-intensive means of mechanized land transport and is a component of logistics. Along with various engineered components, rails constitute a large part of the permanent way. They provide smooth and hard surfaces on which the wheels of the train can roll with a minimum of friction. As an example, a typical modern wagon can hold up to 125 tons of freight on two four-wheel bogies/trucks (100 tons in UK). The contact area between each wheel and the rail is tiny, a strip no more than a few millimetres wide, which minimizes friction. In addition, the track distributes the weight of the train evenly, allowing significantly greater loads per axle / wheel than in road transport, leading to less wear and tear on the permanent way. This can save energy compared with other forms of transportation, such as road transport, which depends on the friction between rubber tires and the road. Trains also have a small frontal area in relation to the load they are carrying, which cuts down on forward air resistance and thus energy usage, although this does not necessarily reduce the effects of side winds. In all, under the right circumstances, a train needs 50-70 percent less energy to transport a given tonnage of freight (or given number of passengers) than does road transport.
Due to these various benefits, rail transport is a major form of public transport in many countries. In Asia, for example, many millions use trains as regular transport in India, China, South Korea and Japan. It is also widespread in European countries. By comparison, intercity rail transport in the United States is relatively scarce outside the Northeast Corridor, although a number of major U.S. cities have heavily-used, local rail-based passenger transport systems or light rail or commuter rail operations.(Wikipedia)</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_BUILDING_MONT_ST_MICHEL_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB] Mont Saint-Michel was used in the 6th and 7th centuries as an Armorican stronghold of Romano-Breton culture and power, until it was ransacked by the Franks, thus ending the trans-channel culture that had stood since the departure of the Romans in AD 460.
Before the construction of the first monastic establishment in the 8th century, the island was called Mont Tombe. According to legend, the archangel Michael appeared to St. Aubert, bishop of Avranches, in 708 and instructed him to build a church on the rocky islet. Aubert repeatedly ignored the angel's instruction, until Michael burned a hole in the bishop's skull with his finger.
The mount gained strategic significance in 933 when William "Long Sword", Duke of Normandy, annexed the Cotentin Peninsula, definitively placing the mount in Normandy. It is depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry, which commemorates the 1066 Norman conquest of England. Ducal patronage financed the spectacular Norman architecture of the abbey in subsequent centuries.
In 1067, the monastery of Mont Saint-Michel gave its support to duke William of Normandy in his claim to the throne of England. It was rewarded with properties and grounds on the English side of the Channel, including a small island located at the west of Cornwall, which, modelled after the Mount, became a Norman priory named St Michael's Mount of Penzance.
During the Hundred Years' War the English made repeated assaults on the island but were unable to seize it partly due to the abbey's improved fortifications. Les Michelettes, two wrought-iron bombards left by the English in their failed 1423_24 siege of Mont Saint-Michel, are still displayed near the outer defense wall.
The wealth and influence of the abbey extended to many daughter foundations, including St Michael's Mount in Cornwall. However, its popularity and prestige as a centre of pilgrimage waned with the Reformation, and by the time of the French Revolution there were scarcely any monks in residence. The abbey was closed and converted into a prison, initially to hold clerical opponents of the republican r&#233;gime. High-profile political prisoners followed, but by 1836 influential figures, including Victor Hugo, had launched a campaign to restore what was seen as a national architectural treasure. The prison was finally closed in 1863, and the mount was declared a historic monument in 1874. The Mont Saint Michel and its bay were added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites in 1979, as they rank very high on such World Heritage Site criteria as cultural, historical, and architectural significance, as well as human-created and natural beauty.

Im Kloster leben und arbeiten noch heute etwa ein Dutzend Benediktinerm&#246;nche, und der Mont hat sich wieder zu einer gro&#223;en Touristenattraktion und auch erneut - noch in geringem, aber wachsenden Umfang - zu einem Pilgerort entwickelt, unter anderem im Zusammenhang mit dem Jakobsweg.

		<English>[TAB] A school is an institution designed to allow and encourage students (or "pupils") to learn, under the supervision of teachers. Most countries have systems of formal education, which is commonly compulsory. In these systems, students progress through a series of schools. The names for these schools vary by country (discussed in the Regional section below), but generally include primary school for young children and secondary school for teenagers who have completed primary education. [PARAGRAPH:2][TAB] Modern systems of education in Europe derive their origins from the schools of medieval period. Most schools during this era were founded upon religious principles with the sole purpose of training the clergy. [PARAGRAPH:2][TAB] India has a long history of organized education. The Gurukul system of education supported traditional Hindu residential schools of learning; typically the teacher's house or a monastery. Education was free, but students from well-to-do families paid "Gurudakshina," a voluntary contribution after the completion of their studies. At the Gurukuls, the teacher imparted knowledge of Religion, Scriptures, Philosophy, Literature, Warfare, Statecraft, Medicine Astrology and History (the Sanskrit word "Itihaas" means History). [PARAGRAPH:2][TAB] Unlike in many regions of the world, education in China began not with organised religions, but based upon the reading of classical Chinese texts, which developed during Western Zhou period. This system of education was further developed by the early Chinese state, which depended upon literate, educated officials for operation of the empire, and an imperial examination system was established in the Han Dynasty (206 BC-220) for evaluating and selecting officials. This merit-based system gave rise to schools that taught the classics and continued in use for 2,000 years, until the end the Qing Dynasty, and was abolished in 1911 in favour of Western education methods.

Although the calmecac has been characterized as for elites only, Sahagun's account says that at times commoners, macehualtin, were assigned to the calmecac as well and trained for the priesthood. The calmecac was the students' home for the duration of their training, and they would enter the school as young as five to seven years of age. The students received instruction in songs, rituals, reading and writing. Students commenced formal military training around age fifteen. (Wikipedia)</English>

In countries with a presidential system, such as the United States, the cabinet does not function as a collective legislative influence; rather, their primary role is as an unofficial advisory council to the head of government, consisting of the heads of the executive departments they are appointed to lead. Instead of just one view, the president gets opinions and advice in upcoming decisions. In some countries, cabinets are required to be appointed from sitting members of the legislature while in others, such as the United States, cabinet members may not be sitting legislators; they must resign their legislative office if they accept a cabinet appointment.[PARAGRAPH:2][TAB] In most governments, members of the cabinet are given the title of minister, and each holds a different portfolio of government duties ("Minister for the Environment", etc). In a few governments, as in the case of the United States and the Philippines, the title of secretary is also used for some cabinet members ("Secretary of Education", etc). The day-to-day role of most cabinet members is to serve as the head of one segment of the national bureaucracy, as the head civil servant to which all other employees in that department report. [PARAGRAPH:2][TAB] Historically, cabinets began as smaller sub-groups of the English Privy Council. The term comes from the name for a relatively small and private room used as a study or retreat. Phrases such as "cabinet counsel", meaning advice given in private to the monarch, occur from the late 16th century, and, given the non-standardized spelling of the day, it is often hard to distinguish whether "council" or "counsel" is meant. The OED credits Francis Bacon in his Essays (1605) with the first use of "Cabinet council", where it is described as a foreign habit, of which he disapproves: "For which inconveniences, the doctrine of Italy, and practice of France, in some kings_ times, hath introduced cabinet counsels; a remedy worse than the disease". Charles I began a formal "Cabinet Council" from his accession in 1625, as his Privy Council, or "private council", was evidently not private enough, and the first recorded use of "cabinet" by itself for such a body comes from 1644, and is again hostile and associates the term with dubious foreign practices. The process has repeated itself in recent times, as leaders have felt the need to have a Kitchen Cabinet. (Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] The Colosseum or Coliseum, originally the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium, Italian Anfiteatro Flavio or Colosseo), is an elliptical amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy, the largest ever built in the Roman Empire. It is one of the greatest works of Roman architecture and engineering.
Occupying a site just east of the Roman Forum, its construction started between 70 and 72 AD under the emperor Vespasian and was completed in 80 AD under Titus, with further modifications being made during Domitian's reign (81_96). The name "Amphitheatrum Flavium" derives from both Vespasian's and Titus's family name (Flavius, from the gens Flavia).
Originally capable of seating around 50,000 spectators, the Colosseum was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles. It remained in use for nearly 500 years with the last recorded games being held there as late as the 6th century. As well as the traditional gladiatorial games, many other public spectacles were held there, such as mock sea battles, animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Classical mythology. The building eventually ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era. It was later reused for such varied purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, a fortress, a quarry and a Christian shrine.
Although it is now in a ruined condition due to damage caused by earthquakes and stone-robbers, the Colosseum has long been seen as an iconic symbol of Imperial Rome. Today it is one of modern Rome's most popular tourist attractions and still has close connections with the Roman Catholic Church, as each Good Friday the Pope leads a torchlit "Way of the Cross" procession to the amphitheatre.

		<English>[TAB] The Hanseatic League (Hansa) was formed around the middle of the 12th century by German and Scandinavian seafaring merchants. Since there were no navies to protect their cargoes, no international bodies to regulate tariffs and trade, and few ports had regulatory authorities to manage their use, the merchants banded together to establish tariff agreements, provide for common defense and to make sure ports were safely maintained.
The original network linked L&#252;beck, Westfalia, Saxony and Gotland, but it quickly spread east with the conquest of Livonia in the early 13th century. The league became so profitable and so powerful that it lasted over three centuries. At its peak, the Hanseatic League covered the entire North Sea and Baltic Sea Regions and it stretched hundreds of miles inland along rivers from the Rhine to the Daugava.
Though Hansa relations were primarily economic in nature, the League became a formidable political and military power in the 14th Century. The Baltic Region that is known today as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania became a viable economic unit in the world market and participant in European politics via the relationships fostered by the Hansa. </English>

		<English>[TAB] Limited liability is a legal status where a person's financial liability is limited to a fixed sum, most commonly the value of a person's investment in a corporation, company or partnership. If a company that provides limited liability to its investors is sued, then the claimants are generally entitled to collect only against the assets of the company, not the assets of its shareholders or other investors. A shareholder in a corporation or limited liability company is not personally liable for any of the debts of the company, other than for the amount already invested in the company and for any unpaid amount on the shares in the company, if any, except under special and rare circumstances permitting "piercing the corporate veil." The same is true for the members of a limited liability partnership and the limited partners in a limited partnership. 
		[TAB] The world's first modern limited liability law was enacted by the state of New York in 1811. In England it became more straightforward to incorporate a joint stock company following the Joint Stock Companies Act 1844, although investors in such companies carried unlimited liability until the Limited Liability Act 1855. Similar statutory regimes were in place in France and in the majority of the U.S. states by 1860. By the final quarter of the nineteenth century, most European countries had adopted the principle of limited liability. The development of limited liability facilitated the move to large-scale industrial enterprise, by removing the threat that an individual's total wealth would be confiscated if invested in an unsuccessful company. Large sums of personal financial capital became available, and the transferability of shares permitted a degree of business continuity not possible in other forms of enterprise.[(Wikipedia)</English>
		<German>[TAB] Scientific management (also called Taylorism, the Taylor system, or the Classical Perspective) is a theory of management that analyzes and synthesizes workflow processes, improving labor productivity. The core ideas of the theory were developed by Frederick Winslow Taylor in the 1880s and 1890s, and were first published in his monographs, Shop Management (1905) and The Principles of Scientific Management (1911). Taylor believed that decisions based upon tradition and rules of thumb should be replaced by precise procedures developed after careful study of an individual at work.
In management literature today, the greatest use of the concept of Taylorism is as a contrast to a new, improved way of doing business. In political and sociological terms, Taylorism can be seen as the division of labour pushed to its logical extreme, with a consequent de-skilling of the worker and dehumanisation of the workplace.

The building predates Islam, and, according to Islamic tradition, the first building at the site was built by Abraham. The building has a mosque built around it, the Masjid al-Haram. All Muslims around the world face the Kaaba during prayers, no matter where they are.
One of the Five Pillars of Islam requires every capable Muslim to perform the Hajj pilgrimage at least once in their lifetime. Multiple parts of the Hajj require pilgrims to walk several times around the Kaaba in a counter-clockwise direction (as viewed from above). This circumambulation, the Tawaf, is also performed by pilgrims during the Umrah (lesser pilgrimage). However, the most dramatic times are during the Hajj, when about three million (officially) pilgrims simultaneously gather to circle the building on the same day. (Wikipedia)</English>

Among Muslims, the Mount is the site of one of the three Sacred Mosques, the holiest sites in Islam. Amongst Sunni Muslims, it is considered the third holiest site in Islam. Revered as the Noble Sanctuary, the location of Muhammad's journey to Jerusalem and ascension to heaven, the site is also associated with the Jewish biblical prophets who are also venerated in Islam. Umayyad Caliphs commissioned the construction of the al-Aqsa Mosque and Dome of the Rock on the site. The Dome was completed in 692 CE, making it one of the oldest extant Islamic structures in the world. The Al Aqsa Mosque rests on the far southern side of the Mount, facing Mecca. The Dome of the Rock currently sits in the middle, occupying or close to the area where the Holy Temple previously stood. (Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] The Venetian Arsenal (Italian: Arsenale di Venezia) is a shipyard and naval depot that played a leading role in Venetian empire-building. It was one of the most important areas of Venice, lying in the Castello sestiere.
The Byzantine-style establishment may have existed as early as the eighth century, though the present structure is usually said to have been begun in 1104 during the reign of Ordelafo Faliero, although there is no evidence for such a precise date. It definitely existed by the early thirteenth century and is mentioned in Dante's Inferno. The name probably comes from Arabic Dar al Sina_a ("Dockyard") and the concept was clearly Islamic as much as Byzantine.
Initially the state dockyard worked merely to maintain naval ships built privately, but in 1320 the Arsenal Nuovo was built, much larger than the original. It enabled all the state's navy and the larger merchant ships to be both constructed and maintained in one place. The Arsenal incidentally became an important centre for rope manufacture, while housing for the arsenal workers grew up outside its walls.
Venice developed methods of mass-producing warships in the Arsenal, including the frame-first system to replace the Roman hull-first practice. The new system was much faster and required less wood. At the peak of its efficiency in the early sixteenth century, the Arsenal employed some 16,000 people who apparently were able to produce nearly one ship each day, and could fit out, arm, and provision a newly-built galley with standardized parts on a production-line basis not seen again until the Industrial Revolution.
The staff of the Arsenal also developed new firearms at an early date, beginning with bombards in the 1370s and numerous small arms against the Genoese a few years later. Improvements in handguns led to their muzzle velocity (and therefore their ability to penetrate armor) exceeding that of the crossbow. The Venetian condottieri leader, Bartolomeo Colleoni, is usually given credit as being the first to mount the Arsenal's new lighter-weight artillery on mobile carriages for field use.
The Arsenal's main gate, the Porta Magna, was built in about 1460 and was the first Classical revival structure to be built in Venice. It was perhaps built by Antonio Gambello from a design by Jacopo Bellini. Two lions taken from Greece situated beside it were added in 1687. One of the lions, known as the Piraeus Lion, is notable for having been defaced with lengthy runic inscriptions carved in the eleventh century by Scandinavian mercenary soldiers.
The Arsenal Novissimo was begun in 1473. It enabled the creation of a system similar to an assembly line, in which hulls were constructed in the newer areas of the Arsenal before being fitted out in the old Arsenal.
In the late sixteenth century, the Arsenal's designers experimented with larger ships as platforms for heavy naval guns. The most impressive was the galleass, already used at Lepanto, and developed from the old merchanting "great galley". It was huge, with sails as well as oars, and was virtually a floating fortress, with guns mounted on wheeled carriages along the sides in the modern fashion. It was slow and unwieldy in battle, however, and few were ever built. The galleon, also developed at the Arsenal, was an armed sailing ship, a slimmer version of the merchant "round ship". It was useful in major naval battles, but not in the small bays and off the frequent lee shores of the Dalmatian coast.
Significant parts of the Arsenal were destroyed under Napoleonic rule, and later rebuilt to enable the Arsenal's present use as a naval base. It is also used as a research centre, an exhibition venue during the Venice Biennale and is home to a historic boat preservation centre. (Wikipedia)</English>

Designed by Joseph Paxton, the Great Exhibition building was 1,851 feet (564 m) long, with an interior height of 108 feet (33 m).
After the exhibition, the building was moved to a new park in a high, healthy and wealthy area of London called Sydenham Hill, an area not much changed today from the well-heeled suburb full of large Victorian villas that it was during its Victorian heyday. The Crystal Palace was enlarged and stood from 1854 until 1936, when it was destroyed by fire. It attracted many thousands of visitors from all levels of society. The name Crystal Palace (coined by the satirical magazine Punch) was later used to denote this area of south London and the park that surrounds the site, home of the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre.

Built in 507, the larger in 554, the statues represented the classic blended style of Gandhara art.
The main bodies were hewn directly from the sandstone cliffs, but details were modeled in mud mixed with straw, coated with stucco.

It is believed that the upper parts of their faces were made from great wooden masks or casts. The rows of holes that can be seen in photographs were spaces that held wooden pegs which served to stabilize the outer stucco.
They were intentionally dynamited and destroyed in 2001 by the Taliban, on orders from leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, after the Taliban government declared that they were "idols" (which are forbidden under Sharia law).

		Scholars - including the most renowned of the era - came from great distances to lodge in the academy: the Taoist philosophers Tian Pia, Shen Dao, Peng Meng, and possibly Zhuangzi; Zou Yan, the founder of the School of Naturalists; the Mohist philosopher Song Xing; and the Confucian philosophers Mencius, Xun Zi, and Chunyu Kun. The famous scenes of the Mencius dealing with King Xuan arose from the philosopher's time at the academy. The Jixia Academy was also the original center of the Huanglao school and was involved with the compilation of the Guanzi essay "Inward Training" that is the oldest received writing concerning "cultivation of vapor" and meditation.

		<English>[TAB]Longhouses were built by native peoples in various parts of North America, sometimes reaching over 100 meters long (330 ft) but generally around 5 to 7 meters wide (16-23 ft). The construction method was also different: the dominant theory is that walls were made of sharpened and fire-hardened poles (up to 1,000 saplings for a 50 meter house) driven into the ground with their tops bent over and tied to the poles of the opposite wall. Strips of bark were then woven horizontally through the lines of poles to form more or less weatherproof walls with doors usually in one end of the house, although doors also were built into sides of especially long longhouses.[NEWLINE]The Iroquois (Haudenosaunee or People of the Longhouses) who lived in New York and Ontario built and lived in longhouses. Longer than they were wide, these longhouses had openings at both ends that served as doors and were covered with animal skins during the winter to keep out the cold. On average a typical longhouse was about 80 feet long by 18 feet wide and was meant to house up to twenty or more families. Poles were set in the ground and supported by horizontal poles along the walls. The roof is made by bending a series of poles, resulting in an arc-shaped roof. The frame is covered by bark that is sewn in place and layered as shingles, and reinforced by light poles. Missionaries who visited these longhouses often wrote about how dark the interior of the dwelling was.[NEWLINE]At the outer regions of the woodland longhouses were invaluable protective palisades that stood fourteen to sixteen feet high safegaurding the housing region from foreign nations and wild animals. Ventilation openings, later singly dubbed as a 'smoke hole' were positioned at intervals possibly totaling five to six along the roofing of the long house. Tribes or ethnic groups in the northeast of North America, south and east of Lake Ontario and Lake Erie that had traditions of building longhouses are, among others, the Iroquois, Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga , Oneida and Mohawk. Also the Wyandot and Erie. Another large group that built longhouses, among others, were the Lenni Lenape, living from the lower Hudson river, along the Delaware river and on both sides of the Delaware Bay, and the Pamunkey of the maybe-related Powhattan Confederacy in Virginia.

The term "wigwam" (a domed structure) is sometimes incorrectly used to refer to a tipi.
The tipi was durable, provided warmth and comfort in winter, was dry during heavy rains, and was cool in the heat of summer. Tipis could be disassembled and packed away quickly when a tribe decided to move and could be reconstructed quickly when the tribe settled in a new area. This portability was important to Plains Indians with their nomadic lifestyle. (Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] Generally, a fishery is an entity engaged in raising and/or harvesting fish, which is determined by some authority to be a fishery. According to the FAO, a fishery is typically defined in terms of the "people involved, species or type of fish, area of water or seabed, method of fishing, class of boats, purpose of the activities or a combination of the foregoing features". The definition often includes a combination of fish and fishers in a region, the latter fishing for similar species with similar gear types.
Fisheries are harvested for their value (commercial, recreational or subsistence). They can be saltwater or freshwater, wild or farmed. Examples are the salmon fishery of Alaska, the cod fishery off the Lofoten islands, the tuna fishery of the Eastern Pacific, or the shrimp farm fisheries in China. Capture fisheries can be broadly classified as industrial scale, small-scale/artisanal, and recreational.		(Wikipedia)</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_BUILDING_TAX_FARMING_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB] Tax farming was originally a Roman practice whereby the burden of tax collection was reassigned by the Roman State to private individuals or groups. In essence, these individuals or groups paid the taxes for a certain area and for a certain period of time and then attempted to cover their outlay by collecting money or saleable goods from the people within that area. The system was set up by Gaius Gracchus in 123 BC primarily to increase the efficiency of tax collection within Rome itself but the system quickly spread to the Provinces. Within the Roman Empire, these private individuals and groups which collected taxes in lieu of the bid (i.e. rent) they had paid to the state were known as publicani, of whom the best known is the disciple Matthew, a publicanus in the village of Capernaum in the province of Galilee. The system was widely abused, and reforms were enacted by Augustus and Diocletian. Tax farming practices are believed to have contributed to the fall of the Western Roman Empire in Western Europe.
		Besides the Romans, historical examples include the tax collection methods of the Ptolemies, Seljuks, Mamluks, Ottomans, the French State prior to Louis XVI, and Russia prior to 1862. In many cases, such as the Abbasid practice of Iqta, these rights were granted by an authority, in this example the caliph, for services rendered or promised. In the Byzantine pronoia system, similar rights were often purchased from the crown. Though such arrangements in some respects seem similar to the feudal system, there are significant disparities, including continuance of state power and, at least in the case of pronoia, theoretical time limits on the grant. In many cases, including those mentioned, tax rights were not transferable or divisible, unlike feudal fiefdoms.(Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] A marae is a sacred place which served for both religious and social purposes in pre-Christian Polynesian societies. In all Polynesian languages, any variant of this word means "cleared, free of weeds, trees, etc." It generally consists of an area of cleared land roughly rectangular, bordered with stones or wooded posts. In the Maori of New Zealand, the marae is still a vital part of everyday life. However, in most other Polynesian societies, most marae were destroyed or abandoned with the arrival of Christianity. Despite all this, marae were built and still considered as a holy place and nobody would build on it. [PARAGRAPH: 1] In Maori society, the marae is a place where the culture can be celebrated. Various intertribal ceremonies were also practiced in the marae. In Maori usage, marae is technically the enclosed space in front of a meeting house. However, it is usually used to describe the marae itself and the surrounded complex. The meeting house is the setting for important meetings, sleepovers, and craft and cultural activities. The wharakeai, dining hall, is sued primarily for communal meals. Many of the words associated with marae in tropical Polynesia are kept in the Maori context. (Wikipedia)</English>

This sport was practiced in the 1000s AD, and it was a predecessor of basketball and football, surviving in rural areas even to modern times. Football has dominated Latin American culture ever since it arrived on the continent, and in turn has led to a worldwide domination of the sport by Latin Americans by many measures. Across Latin American history, football rivalries - spanning national borders and neighborhood boundaries - have had an outsize influence on politics and identity.</English>

		<English>[TAB] After the Turks conquered much of southern Hungary, a new defensive line inside the country was strongly needed. Out of castles, mansions, churches and monasteries a new defensive line was built with the efforts of the bondsmen of the surrounding area within a short time. A new system of castles was created, which began at the Adriatic Sea, ended at the lower Danube River and enclosed the area that was controlled by the Turks. The most important places were Kanizsa, Gy&#246;r and Kom&#225;rom, in the north &#201;rsek&#250;jv&#225;r, Kassa, Szatm&#225;r and in the east V&#225;rad, Gyula, Lippa and Temesv&#225;r, these fortresses observed every Turkish movement. [PARAGRAPH:1]From the 1550s on, the Vienna council sent some military engineers to Hungary, that rebuilt the most important V&#233;gv&#225;rs to a modern standard. The most important functions of the V&#233;gv&#225;rs were to defend the borders, secure the roads and the river crossings, the prevention of the enemy troop supplies and the security of the people and their goods in the surrounding area. [PARAGRAPH:1]Towers were built from where the defenders could fire at the attacking enemies that wanted to climb the walls, whereas the defenders where protected from enemy bombardments. After 1556 the military council took control over the V&#233;gv&#225;rs, thus they were under a uniform and competent command. Furthermore, smart defenders invented new military equipment and in peaceful times the wine supply didn't only delight the castles crew.</English>

The batey was the area in which batey events (e.g. ceremonies, the ball game, etc.) took place. The batey ceremony (also known as batu) can be viewed from some historical accounts as more of a judicial contest rather than a game.

Heavily influenced by the Egyptians, Nubian kings built their own pyramids 1000 years after Egyptian burial methods had changed. In Nubia, pyramids were built for the first time at El Kurru in 751 BC. The Nubian-style pyramids emulated a form of Egyptian private elite family pyramid that was common during the New Kingdom. There are twice as many Nubian pyramids still standing today as there are Egyptian.
[TAB] The physical proportions of Nubian pyramids differ markedly from the Egyptian pyramids: they are built of stepped courses of horizontally positioned stone blocks and range approximately 6-30 metres (20-98 ft) in height, but rise from fairly small foundation footprints, resulting in tall, narrow structures inclined at approximately 70°. Most also have offering temple structures abutting their base with unique Kushite characteristics. Egyptian pyramids of similar height generally had foundation footprints at least five times larger and were inclined at angles between 40-50°. 
[TAB] The Nubian pyramids were constructed using a combination of mud bricks and stone. The interior chambers were lined with plaster and decorated with scenes from the life of the deceased. The largest pyramid at Mero&#235; is 30 metres (98 ft) high and is thought to have been built for the Nubian queen Amanishakheto.(Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] Nubian pottery of the Makurian era was well-developed and refined. Scholars divide the pottery into three eras. The first period, around 500 to 700, saw fairly simple pottery similar to that of the late Roman Empire. It also saw much of Nubian pottery imported from Egypt rather than produced domestically. After this domestic production increased, with a major production facility at Faras. In this middle era, which lasted until around 1100, the pottery was painted with floral and zoomorphic scenes and showed distinct Umayyad and even Sassanian influences. The late period during Makuria's decline saw domestic production again fall in favour of imports from Egypt. Pottery produced in Makuria became less ornate, but better control of firing temperatures allowed different colours of clay.</English>

A foggara taps underground mountain water sources trapped in and beneath the upper reaches of alluvial fans and channels the water downhill through a series of tunnels, often several kilometres long, to the places where it is needed for irrigation and domestic use. The development of foggaras probably began about 2,500 years ago in Iran, their technology then spreading eastward to Afghanistan and westward to Egypt and eventually all of North Africa. They were used extensively, for example, by the Garamentes (a Berber civilization) for irrigation and water supply.

		<English>[TAB] Porcelain is a ceramic material made by heating raw materials, generally including clay in the form of kaolin, in a kiln to temperatures between 1,200 &#176;C (2,192 &#176;F) and 1,400 &#176;C (2,552 &#176;F). The toughness, strength, and translucence of porcelain arise mainly from the formation of glass and the mineral mullite within the fired body at these high temperatures. 
		Porcelain is generally believed to have originated in China. Although proto-porcelain wares exist dating from the Shang Dynasty about 1600 BCE, by the Eastern Han Dynasty (100-200 BCE) high firing glazed ceramic wares had developed into porcelain, and porcelain manufactured during the Tang Dynasty period (618-906) was exported to the Islamic world, where it was highly prized. Early porcelain of this type includes the tri-color glazed porcelain, or sancai wares. Historian S.A.M. Adshead writes that true porcelain items in the restrictive sense that we know them today could be found in dynasties after the Tang, during the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties.
By the Sui (about 580 AD) and Tang (about 620 AD) dynasties, porcelain had become widely produced. Eventually, porcelain and the expertise required to create it began to spread into other areas; by the seventeenth century, it was being exported to Europe.
Korean and Japanese porcelain also have long histories and distinct artistic traditions.(Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] Brick kilns are designed to finish bricks and produce charcoal or other heat-treated materials. A brick kiln should be constructed to withstand high heat temperatures and have a strong resistance to outdoor elements. There are various designs for brick kilns, the most common types being the beehive model and the slope model. Kilns are an essential part of the manufacture of all ceramics, which, by definition, require heat treatment, often at high temperature. During this process, chemical and physical reactions occur which cause the material to be permanently altered. In the case of pottery, clay materials are shaped, dried and then fired in a kiln. The final characteristics are determined by the composition and preparation of the clay body, by the temperature at which it is fired, and by the glazes that may be used. Although modern kilns often have sophisticated electrical systems to control the firing temperatures, pyrometric devices have been used to provide visual indication of the firing regime since around 1000 AD.

		<English>[TAB] A cement is a binder, a substance used in construction that sets, hardens and adheres to other materials, binding them together. Cement is seldom used solely, but is used to bind sand and gravel (aggregate) together. Cement is used with fine aggregate to produce mortar for masonry, or with sand and gravel aggregates to produce concrete.
		Hydraulic cements (e.g., Portland cement) set and become adhesive due to a chemical reaction between the dry ingredients and water. The chemical reaction results in mineral hydrates that are not very water-soluble and so are quite durable in water and safe from chemical attack. This allows setting in wet condition or underwater and further protects the hardened material from chemical attack. The chemical process for hydraulic cement found by ancient Romans used volcanic ash (pozzolana) with added lime (calcium oxide).
		Portland cement is by far the most common type of cement in general use around the world. This cement is made by heating limestone (calcium carbonate) with other materials (such as clay) to 1450 °C in a kiln, in a process known as calcination, whereby a molecule of carbon dioxide is liberated from the calcium carbonate to form calcium oxide, or quicklime, which then chemically combines with the other materials that have been included in the mix to form calcium silicates and other cementitious compounds. The resulting hard substance, called 'clinker', is then ground with a small amount of gypsum into a powder to make 'ordinary Portland cement', the most commonly used type of cement (often referred to as OPC). Portland cement is a basic ingredient of concrete, mortar and most non-specialty grout. (Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] The origins of the Hashshashin, or Assassins, trace back to just before the First Crusade around 1080. It is difficult to find out much information about the origins of the Hashshashin because most early sources are either written by enemies of the cult or based on legends. Most sources dealing with the order's inner working were destroyed with the capture of Alamut, the Assassin's headquarters. However, it's possible to trace the beginnings of the cult back to its first Grandmaster, Hasan-i Sabbah.
A passionate believer in the Isma'ili beliefs, Hasan-i-Sabbah was well liked throughout Cairo, Syria, and most of the Middle East by other Isam'ili, which led to a number of people becoming his followers. Using his fame and popularity, Sabbah founded the Order of the Assassins. While his motives for founding this order are ultimately unknown, it has been speculated that it was for his own political and personal gain and to also exact vengeance on his enemies. His motivation for political power probably came through what he thought to be dealings with other Muslims in the Middle East, particularly Sunnis, but because of the unrest in the holy land caused by the calling of the Crusades, Hasan-i-Sabbah found himself not only fighting for power with other Muslims, but also with the invading Christian forces.
After creating the Order, Sabbah searched for a location that would be fit for a sturdy headquarters and decided on the fortress at Alamut in what is now North-western Iran. It is still disputed whether Sabbah built the fortress himself or if it was already built at the time of his arrival . Whether he created it himself or not, Sabbah adapted the fortress to suit his needs of not only defense from hostile forces, but also indoctrination of his followers. After laying claim to the fortress at Alamut, Sabbah began expanding his influence outward to nearby towns and districts, using his agents to gain political favour and intimidate the local populations.
Spending most of his days at Alamut working on religious works and doctrines for his Order, Sabbah was never to leave his fortress again in his lifetime. He had established a secret society of deadly assassins, one which was built in a hierarchical format. Below Sabbah, the Grand Headmaster of the Order, was those known as "Greater Propagandists", followed by the normal "Propagandists", the Rafiqs ("Companions"), and the Lasiqs ("Adherents"). It was the Lasiqs which were trained to become some of the most feared assassins, or as they were called, "Fida'i" (self-sacrificing agent), in the known world. (Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] The Ishtar Gate was the eighth gate to the inner city of Babylon. It was constructed in about 575 BC by order of King Nebuchadnezzar II on the north side of the city.
Dedicated to the Babylonian goddess Ishtar, the gate was constructed of blue glazed tiles with alternating rows of bas-relief sirrush (dragons) and aurochs.
The roof and doors of the gate were of cedar, according to the dedication plaque. Through the gate ran the Processional Way, which was lined with walls covered in lions on glazed bricks (about 120 of them).
Statues of the deities were paraded through the gate and down the Processional Way each year during the New Year's celebration.
Originally the gate, being part of the Walls of Babylon, was considered one of the Seven Wonders of the world until, in the 6th century AD, it was replaced by the Lighthouse of Alexandria.
A reconstruction of the Ishtar Gate and Processional Way was built at the Pergamon Museum in Berlin out of material excavated by Robert Koldewey and finished in the 1930s. It includes the inscription plaque. It stands 47 feet high and 100 feet wide (14 meters by 30 meters). The excavation ran from 1902-1914, and, during that time, 45 feet of the foundation of the gate was uncovered.
The gate was in fact a double gate. The part that is shown in the Pergamon Museum today is only the smaller, frontal part, while the larger, back part was considered too large to fit into the constraints of the structure of the museum. It is in storage.
Parts of the gate and lions from the Processional Way are in various other museums around the world. Only three museums acquired dragons, while lions went to several museums. The Istanbul Archaeology Museum has lions, dragons, and bulls. The Detroit Institute of Arts houses a dragon. The R&#246;hsska Museum in Gothenburg, Sweden, has one dragon and one lion; the Louvre, the State Museum of Egyptian Art in Munich, the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in Philadelphia, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Oriental Institute in Chicago, the Rhode Island School of Design Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven, Connecticut, each have lions.

It is a large building with a facade of yellow brick, designed by Alexander V. Ivanov in 1897 and augmented by Aleksey Shchusev in 1940-1947.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]The Lubyanka was originally built in 1898 as the Neo-Baroque headquarters of the All-Russia Insurance Company, noted for its beautiful parquet floors and pale green walls. Belying its massiveness, the edifice avoids an impression of heroic scale: isolated Palladian and Baroque details, such as the minute pediments over the corner bays and the central loggia, are lost in an endlessly-repeating classicizing palace facade, where three bands of cornices emphasize the horizontal lines. A clock is centered in the uppermost band of the facade.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]Following the Bolshevik Revolution, the structure was seized by the government for the headquarters of the secret police, then called the Cheka. In Soviet Russian jokes it was referred to as the tallest building in Moscow, since Siberia could be seen from its basement. Another joke referred to the building as "Adult's World" as compared to "Children's World," the name of the popular toy store across the street.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]During the Great Purge, the offices became increasingly cramped due to staff numbers. In 1940, the most famous Soviet architect, Shchusev, was commissioned to double its size by adding another storey and engulfing backstreet buildings. Shchusev's design accentuated Neo-Renaissance detailing, but only the left part of the facade was reconstructed under his direction in the 1940s, due to the war and other hindrances. This asymmetric facade survived intact until 1983, when the symmetry was restored at the urging of Yuri Andropov in accordance with Shchusev's plans.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]Although the Soviet secret police changed its name many times, its headquarters remained in this building. Secret police chiefs from Lavrenty Beria to Yuri Andropov used the same office on the third floor, which looked down on the statue of Cheka founder Felix Dzerzhinsky. A prison at the ground floor of the building figures prominently in Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's classic study of the Soviet police state, The Gulag Archipelago. Famous inmates held, tortured and interrogated there include Sidney Reilly, Raoul Wallenberg, J&#225;nos Esterh&#225;zy and Father Walter Ciszek, S.J.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]After the dissolution of the KGB, the Lubyanka became the headquarters of the Border Guard Service of Russia, and houses the Lubyanka prison and one directorate of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB). In addition a museum of the KGB was opened to the public. On November 11, 1999 a fire broke out in the Lubyanka. Four FSB agents were injured, but damage was relatively mild.

Some of the Japanese gardens most famous in the West, and within Japan as well, are dry gardens or rock gardens, karesansui. The tradition of the Tea masters has produced highly refined Japanese gardens of quite another style, evoking rural simplicity. In Japanese culture, garden-making is a high art, intimately related to the linked arts of calligraphy and ink painting. Since the end of the 19th century, Japanese gardens have also been adapted to Western settings.
Japanese gardens were developed under the influences of the distinctive and stylized Chinese gardens. One of the great interest for the historical development of the Japanese garden, bonseki, bonsai and related arts is the c. 1300 Zen monk Kokan Shiren and his rhymeprose essay Rhymeprose on a Miniature Landscape Garden.
The tradition of Japanese gardening was historically passed down from sensei to apprentice. In recent decades this has been supplemented by various trade schools. However, the opening words of Zoen's Illustrations for designing mountain, water and hillside field landscapes (1466) are "If you have not received the oral transmissions, you must not make gardens" and its closing admonition is "You must never show this writing to outsiders. You must keep it secret". (Wikipedia)</English>

A new dohyo is built prior to each tournament by the yobidashi, who are responsible for this activity. The dohyo is removed after each tournament, and in the case of Nagoya, pieces are taken home by the fans as souvenirs. The yobidashi also build the dohyo for training stables and sumo touring events.
The diameter of the ring is 15 shaku (4.55 meters), which increased from 13 shaku (3.94 meters) in 1931. The rice-straw bales which form the ring are one third standard size and are partially buried in the clay of the dohyo. Four of the tawara are placed slightly outside the line of the circle. In olden times this was to allow rain to run off the surface, when sumo tournaments were held outdoors in the open. Today a wrestler under pressure at the edge of the ring will often try to move himself round to one of these points to gain leverage in order to push back more effectively against the opponent who is trying to force him out.
At the center are two white lines, the shikiri-sen, behind which the wrestlers must position themselves at the start of the bout. Around the ring is finely brushed sand called the ja-no-me, which can be used to determine if a wrestler has just touched his foot, or another part of his body, outside the ring. The yobidashi ensure it is clean of any previous marks immediately prior to each bout.
A roof resembling that of a Shinto shrine (which has been of the Shinmei-zukuri style since the 1953 Natsu Basho) is suspended above the dohyo. Colored tassels (fusa), which replaced support columns in the 1952 Aki Basho, are suspended from the corners, representing the four spirits of directions:
 Azure Dragon of the East 
 Vermilion Bird of the South

The earliest description of the banya comes from the Russian Primary Chronicle of 1113. According to the Chronicle, or as it was called by its authors, The Tale of Bygone Years, the Apostle Andrew visited the territories that were later to become Russia during his visit to the Greek colonies on the Black Sea. The belief was held that Andrew crossed through Russia from the mouth of the Dnieper River, passed the hills on which Kiev would later be founded, and went as far north as the ancient city of Novgorod.
"Wondrous to relate," said he, "I saw the land of the Slavs, and while I was among them, I noticed their wooden bathhouses. They warm them to extreme heat, then undress, and after anointing themselves with tallow, they take young reeds and lash their bodies. They actually lash themselves so violently that they barely escape alive. Then they drench themselves with cold water, and thus are revived. They think nothing of doing this every day, and actually inflict such voluntary torture on themselves. They make of the act not a mere washing but a veritable torment."
Another mention of the banya is found in the same Chronicle in the story of Princess Olga's revenge for the murder of her husband, Prince Igor, by the Slavic tribe of Drevlians in 945 AD. The leader of the Drevlians had hopes of marrying the widow Olga and sent messengers to discuss the idea. "When the Drevlians arrived, Olga commanded that a bath should be made ready for them and said, 'Wash yourselves and come to me.' The bath-house was heated and the unsuspecting Drevlians entered and began to wash themselves. Olga's men closed the bath-house behind them and Olga gave orders to set it on fire from the doors, so that the Drevlians were all burned to death."		(Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] Originally borrowed from the early Proto-Germanic *stakna- whose descendants include English stack, the word sauna is an ancient Finnish word referring to the traditional Finnish bath and to the bathhouse itself. The oldest known saunas in Finland were made from pits dug in a slope in the ground and primarily used as dwellings in winter. The sauna featured a fireplace where stones were heated to a high temperature. Water was thrown on the hot stones to produce steam and to give a sensation of increased heat. This would raise the apparent temperature so high that people could take off their clothes. The first Finnish saunas are what nowadays are called savusaunas, or smoke saunas. These differed from present-day saunas in that they were heated by heating a pile of rocks called kiuas by burning large amounts of wood about 6 to 8 hours, and then letting the smoke out before enjoying the löyly, or sauna heat. A properly heated "savusauna" gives heat up to 12 hours. As a result of the Industrial Revolution, the sauna evolved to use a metal woodstove with a chimney. Air temperatures averaged around 75-100 °C but sometimes exceeded 110 °C in a traditional Finnish sauna. 
[TAB] When the Finns migrated to other areas of the globe they brought their sauna designs and traditions with them. Although the culture of sauna nowadays is more or less related to Finnish culture, the evolution of sauna happened around the same time both in Finland and the Baltic countries sharing the same meaning and importance of sauna in daily life, shared still to this day. In Finland, there are built-in saunas in almost every house. (Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] A ranch is an area of landscape, including various structures, given primarily to the practice of ranching, the practice of raising grazing livestock such as cattle or sheep for meat or wool. The word most often applies to livestock-raising operations in the western United States and Canada, though there are ranches in other areas. People who own or operate a ranch are called stockgrowers or ranchers. Ranching is also a method used to raise less common livestock such as elk, American bison or even ostrich, emu, and alpacas.
Ranches generally consist of large areas, but may be of nearly any size. In the western United States, many ranches are a combination of privately owned land supplemented by grazing leases on land under the control of the federal Bureau of Land Management. If the ranch includes arable or irrigated land, the ranch may also engage in a limited amount of farming, raising crops for feeding the animals, such as hay and feed grains.
Ranches that cater exclusively to tourists are called guest ranches or, colloquially, "dude ranches." Most working ranches do not cater to guests, though they may allow private hunters or outfitters onto their property to hunt native wildlife. However, in recent years, a few struggling smaller operations have added some dude ranch features, such as horseback rides, cattle drives or guided hunting, in an attempt to bring in additional income. Ranching is part of the iconography of the "Wild West" as seen in Western movies and rodeos. (Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] Amaterasu is a part of the Japanese myth cycle and also a major deity of the Shinto religion. She is seen as the goddess of the sun, but also of the universe. The name Amaterasu derived from Amateru means "shining in heaven". The meaning of her whole name, Amaterasu-&#333;mikami, is "the great august kami (god) who shines in the heaven". Amaterasu appears to be the Japanese expression of a historical pan-Asiatic solar goddess. Several similarities have been noticed between the Japanese solar goddess and the Korean solar goddess Hae-nim, particularly in regards to shamanistic worship, using the same symbols and practices. Another possible expression is the Chinese Xihe. Though historically probably venerated highly, only in Japan did this deity find continuous worship as a central figure, as elsewhere several other religious movements such as Buddhism and Taoism discouraged the veneration of solar goddesses. The worship of Amaterasu to the exclusion of other kami has been described as "the cult of the sun". (Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] The Pyramid of the Sun is the largest building in Teotihuac&#225;n and one of the largest in Mesoamerica. Found along the Avenue of the Dead, in between the Pyramid of the Moon and the Ciudadela, and in the shadow of the massive mountain Cerro Gordo, the pyramid is part of a large complex in the heart of the city.
The name Pyramid of the Sun comes from the Aztecs, who visited the city of Teotihuac&#225;n centuries after it was abandoned; the name given to the pyramid by the Teotihuacanos is unknown. It was constructed in two phases. The first construction stage, around 100 A.D., brought the pyramid to nearly the size it is today. The second round of construction resulted in its completed size of 733 feet (225 meters) across and 246 feet (75 meters) high, making it the third largest pyramid in the world, being slightly smaller than Great Pyramid of Giza (230 meters), but much smaller than the Great Pyramid of Cholula (450 meters). The second phase also saw the construction of an altar atop of the pyramid, which has not survived into modern times. The Adosada platform was added to the pyramid in the early third century, at around the same time that the Ciudadela and Temple of the Feathered Serpent, Teotihuacan Pyramid of the Feathered Serpent were constructed.
Over the structure the ancient Teotihuacanos finished their pyramid with lime plaster imported from surrounding areas, on which they painted brilliantly colored murals. While the pyramid has endured for centuries, the paint and plaster have not and are no longer visible. Few images are thought to have been included in the mural decorations on the sides of the pyramid. Jaguar heads and paws, stars, and snake rattles are among the few images associated with the pyramids.
It is thought that the pyramid venerated a deity within Teotihuacan society but the destruction of the temple on top of the pyramid, by both deliberate and natural forces prior to the archaeological study of the site, has so far prevented identification of the pyramid with any particular deity. However, little evidence exists to support this theory. (Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] The Great Temple of the Aten was located in the city of el-Amarna, Egypt, and was the main temple for the worship of the god Aten during the reign of Akhenaten (c. 1353-1336 BCE). Akhenaten ushered in a unique period of ancient Egyptian history by establishing the new religious cult dedicated to the sun-disk Aten. Akhenaten shut down traditional worship of other deities like Amun-Ra and brought in a new era, though short-lived, of seeming monotheism where the Aten was worshipped as a sun god and Akhenaten and his wife, Nefertiti, represented the divinely royal couple that connected the people with the god. Although he began construction at Karnak during his rule, the association the city had with other gods drove Akhenaten to establish a new city and capital at Amarna (then called Akhetaten) for the Aten. Akhenaten built the city along the east bank of the Nile River, setting up workshops, palaces, suburbs and temples. The Great Temple of the Aten was located just north of the Central City and, as the largest temple dedicated to the Aten, was where Akhenaten fully established the proper cult and worship of the sun-disk.

Purportedly the home of the Sacred Mirror, the shrine is one of Shinto's holiest and most important sites. Access to both sites is strictly limited, with the common public not allowed beyond sight of the thatched roofs of the central structures, hidden behind four tall wooden fences. However, tourists are free to roam the forest, including its ornamental walkways, after Meiji period.
During the Edo period, it is estimated that one out of ten Japanese conducted an Okage Mai-Ri pilgrimage to the shrine. Accordingly, pilgrimage to the shrine flourished in both commercial and religious frequency. Because the shrine is considered sanctuary, no security checkpoints were conducted, as it was considered sacrilege by the faithful. The two main shrines of Ise are joined by a pilgrimage road that passes through the old entertainment district of Furuichi. (Wikipedia)</English>

It was probably constructed under the supervision of the architect Apollodorus of Damascus at the order of the Roman Senate. It is located in Trajan's Forum, built near the Quirinal Hill, north of the Roman Forum. Completed in AD 113 , the freestanding column is most famous for its spiral bas relief, that artistically describes the epic wars between the Romans and Dacians (101-102 and 105-106). Its design has inspired numerous victory columns, both ancient and modern.
The structure is about 30 metres in height, 35 metres including its large pedestal. The shaft is made from a series of 20 colossal Carrara marble drums, each weighing about 32 tons, with a diameter of 3.7 metres. The 190-metre frieze winds around the shaft 23 times. Inside the shaft, a spiral staircase of 185 stairs provides access to a viewing platform at the top. The capital block of Trajan's Column weighs 53.3 tons, which had to be lifted to a height of c. 34 m.
Ancient coins indicate preliminary plans to top the column with a statue of a bird, probably an eagle,but after construction a statue of Trajan was put in place; this statue disappeared in the Middle Ages. On December 4, 1587, the top was crowned by Pope Sixtus V with a bronze figure of St. Peter, which remains to this day. (Wikipedia)</English>

In 1600, Tokugawa Ieyasu awarded the castle to Ikeda Terumasa for his help in the Battle of Sekigahara, and Ikeda completely rebuilt the castle from 1601 to 1609, expanding it into a large castle complex. Several buildings were later added to the castle complex by Honda Tadamasa from 1617 to 1618. For over 400 years, Himeji Castle has remained intact, even throughout the extensive bombing of Himeji in World War II, and natural disasters such as the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake.

Some have called it Tenan, which in Nahuatl, means "mother or protective stone." The Pyramid of the Moon covers a structure older than the Pyramid of the Sun which existed prior to 200 AD.
The Pyramid's construction between 200 and 450 AD completed the bilateral symmetry of the temple complex. A slope in front of the staircase gives access to the Avenue of the Dead, a platform atop the pyramid was used to conduct ceremonies in honor of the Great Goddess of Teotihuacan, the goddess of water, fertility, the earth, and even creation itself. This platform and the sculpture found at the pyramid's bottom are thus dedicated to The Great Goddess.
Opposite the Great Goddess's altar is the Plaza of the Moon. The Plaza contains a central altar and an original construction with internal divisions, consisting of four rectangular and diagonal bodies that formed what is known as the "Teotihuacan Cross." (Wikipedia)</English>

The church that has the function of cathedral is not of necessity a large building.

		<English>[TAB] In the Eastern Orthodox Church, both monks and nuns follow a similar ascetic discipline, and even their religious habit is the same (though nuns wear an extra veil, called the apostolnik). Unlike Roman Catholic monasticism, the Orthodox do not have separate religious orders, but a single monastic form throughout the Orthodox Church. Monastics, male or female, live away from the world, in order to pray for the world. They do not normally run hospitals and orphanages, they do not consider teaching or caring for the sick a part of their vocation, though they are obligated by Christian charity to provide help when needed.
Monasteries vary from the very large to the very small. There are three types of monastic houses in the Orthodox Church:
 * When monks live together, work together, and pray together, following the directions of an abbot and the elder monks, this is called a cenobium. The concept of the cenobitic life is that when many men (or women) live together in a monastic context, like rocks with sharp edges, their "sharpness" becomes worn away and they become smooth and polished. The largest monasteries can hold many thousands of monks and are called lavras. In the cenobium the daily office, work and meals are all done in common.
 * Sketes are small monastic establishments that usually consist of one elder and 2 or 3 disciples. In the skete most prayer and work are done in private, coming together on Sundays and feast days. Thus, skete life has elements of both solitude and community, and for this reason is called the "middle way".
 * The highest level of asceticism is practised by monks who do not live in monastic communities, but in solitude, as hermits.
One of the great centres of Orthodox monasticism is Mount Athos in Greece, an isolated, self-governing peninsula approximately 20 miles (32 km) long and 5 miles (8.0 km) wide (similar to the Vatican, being a separate government), administered by the heads of the 20 monasteries. Today the population of the Holy Mountain is around 2,200 men only and can only be visited by men with special permission granted by both the Greek government and the government of the Holy Mountain itself.

The trained workers of the guilds provided a congenial atmosphere for work. They procured raw materials for manufacturing, controlled quality of manufactured goods and their price, and located markets for their sale. Though seen through the Eurocentric blinkers they have been misunderstood. It was believed that the Indian Guild system also followed the European feudal or the manorial system of the high Middle Ages, due mainly to sudden increase in trade. These European guilds identified as Merchant Guilds and Craft Guilds lasted in some places until the nineteenth and the twentieth century, though probably their golden age was in the thirteenth and the fourteenth centuries. The Craft Guilds being the direct producers were more important than the Merchant Guilds. But the Indian guilds were far more important and complex institutions than the European examples.</English>

		<English>[TAB] Scriptorium, literally "a place for writing", is commonly used to refer to a room in medieval European monasteries devoted to the copying of manuscripts by monastic scribes. Written accounts, surviving buildings, and archaeological excavations all show, however, that contrary to popular belief such rooms rarely existed: most monastic writing was done in cubicle-like recesses in the cloister, or in the monks' own cells. References in modern scholarly writings to "scriptoria" more usually refer to the collective written output of a monastery, rather than to a physical room.
A scriptorium was a necessary adjunct to a library; wherever there was a library it can ordinarily be assumed that there was a scriptorium. Scriptoria in the conventional sense of a room set aside for the purpose probably only existed for limited periods of time, when an institution or individual wanted a large number of texts copied to stock a library; once the library was stocked, there was no further need for a designated room. By the start of the 13th century secular copy-shops developed; professional scribes may have had special rooms set aside for writing, but in most cases they probably simply had a writing-desk next to a window in their own house.

Originally, a barony was the land subject to a baron and could, in England after the Norman Conquest, consist of estates scattered throughout the country or in several regions (see, for example, the barony of the earl of Pembroke, with estates in England, Ireland, and Normandy). A mediaeval barony might comprise more than one manor or fief, and the principal manor often had a castle. (Wikipedia)</English>

(A souq, by contrast, is an open-air marketplace or commercial quarter.) The term is sometimes also used to refer to the "network of merchants, bankers and craftsmen" who work that area. Although the current meaning of the word is believed to have originated in Persia, its use has spread and now has been accepted into the vernacular in countries around the world. The rise of large bazaars and stock trading centers in the Muslim World allowed the creation of new capitals and eventually new empires. New and wealthy cities such as Isfahan, Golconda, Samarkand, Cairo, Baghdad, and Timbuktu were founded along trade routes and bazaars. (Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] Agra Fort is a UNESCO World Heritage site located in Agra, India. It is about 2.5 km northwest of its more famous sister monument, the Taj Mahal. The fort can be more accurately described as a walled city.
After Panipat, Mughals captured the fort and a vast treasure - which included a diamond that was later named as the Koh-i-Noor diamond - was seized. Babur stayed in the fort in the palace of Ibrahim. He built a baoli (step well) in it. Humayun was crowned here in 1530. Humayun was defeated in Bilgram in 1540. Sher Shah held the fort for five years. The Mughals defeated the Afghans finally at Panipat in 1556.
Realizing the importance of its central situation, Akbar made it his capital and arrived in Agra in 1558. His historian, Abdul Fazal, recorded that this was a brick fort known as 'Badalgarh' . It was in a ruined condition and Akbar had it rebuilt with red sandstone from Barauli area in Rajasthan. Architects laid the foundation and it was built with bricks in the inner core with sandstone on external surfaces. Builders worked on it for eight years, completing it in 1573.
It was only during the reign of Akbar's grandson, Shah Jahan, that the site took on its current state. The legend is that Shah Jahan built the beautiful Taj Mahal for his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Unlike his grandfather, Shah Jahan tended to have buildings made from white marble, often inlaid with gold or semi-precious gems. He destroyed some of the earlier buildings inside the fort in order to make his own.
At the end of his life, Shah Jahan was imprisoned by his son, Aurangzeb, in the fort. It is rumored that Shah Jahan died in Musamman Burj, a tower with a marble balcony with a view of the Taj Mahal.
The fort was the site of a battle during the Indian rebellion of 1857, which caused the end of the British East India Company's rule in India, and led to a century of direct rule of India by Britain. (Wikipedia)</English>

It is an UNESCO World Heritage Site (along with the nearby Jer&#243;nimos Monastery) because of the significant role it played in the Portuguese maritime discoveries of the era of the Age of Discoveries. The tower was commissioned by King John II to be part of a defense system at the mouth of the Tagus River and a ceremonial gateway to Lisbon.
The tower was built in the early 16th century and is a prominent example of the Portuguese Manueline style, but it also incorporates hints of other architectural styles. The structure was built from lioz limestone and is composed of a bastion and the 30 meter (100 foot), four story tower. It has incorrectly been stated that the tower was built in the middle of the Tagus and now sits near the shore because the river was redirected after the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. In fact, the tower was built on a small island in the Tagus River near the Lisbon shore. (Wikipedia)</English>

It survives in a single manuscript known as the Nowell Codex. Its composition by an anonymous Anglo-Saxon poet is dated between the 8th and the early 11th century. In 1731, the manuscript was badly damaged by a fire that swept through the building which housed a collection of medieval manuscripts that had been assembled by Sir Robert Bruce Cotton. It fell into obscurity for many decades, and its existence did not become widely known again until it was printed in 1815 in an edition prepared by the Icelandic scholar Gr&#237;mur J&#243;nsson Thorkelin.
In the poem, Beowulf, a hero of the Geats, battles three antagonists: Grendel, Grendel's mother, and an unnamed dragon. After the first two victories, Beowulf goes home to Geatland in Sweden and becomes king of the Geats. The last fight takes place fifty years later. In this final battle, Beowulf is fatally wounded. After his death, his servants bury him in a tumulus in Geatland. (Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] The Epic of Gilgamesh is an epic poem from Mesopotamia and is among the earliest known works of literature. Scholars believe that it originated as a series of Sumerian legends and poems about the protagonist of the story, Gilgamesh king of Uruk, which were fashioned into a longer Akkadian epic much later. The most complete version existing today is preserved on 12 clay tablets from the library collection of 7th-century BC Assyrian king Ashurbanipal. The epic was originally titled He who Saw the Deep or Surpassing All Other Kings, which are the first few words of the epic in different versions.
The story revolves around a relationship between Gilgamesh and his close male companion, Enkidu. Enkidu is a wild man created by the gods as Gilgamesh's equal to distract him from oppressing the citizens of Uruk. Together they undertake dangerous quests that incur the displeasure of the gods. Firstly, they journey to the Cedar Mountain to defeat Humbaba, its monstrous guardian. Later they kill the Bull of Heaven that the goddess Ishtar has sent to punish Gilgamesh for spurning her advances.
The latter part of the epic focuses on Gilgamesh's distressed reaction to Enkidu's death, which takes the form of a quest for immortality. Gilgamesh attempts to learn the secret of eternal life by undertaking a long and perilous journey to meet the immortal flood hero, Utnapishtim. Ultimately the poignant words addressed to Gilgamesh in the midst of his quest foreshadow the end result: "The life that you are seeking you will never find. When the gods created man they allotted to him death, but life they retained in their own keeping." Gilgamesh, however, was celebrated by posterity for his building achievements, and for bringing back long-lost cultic knowledge to Uruk as a result of his meeting with Utnapishtim. The story is widely read in translation, and the protagonist, Gilgamesh, has become an icon of popular culture. (Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] The Mahabharata is one of the two major Sanskrit epics of ancient India, the other being the Ramayana. The epic is part of itihasa.
Besides its epic narrative of the Kurukshetra War and the fates of the Kauravas and the Pandavas, the Mahabharata contains much philosophical and devotional material, such as a discussion of the four "goals of life" or purusharthas. The latter are enumerated as dharma (right action), artha (purpose), kama (pleasure), and moksha (liberation). Among the principal works and stories that are a part of the Mahabharata are the Bhagavad Gita, the story of Damayanti, an abbreviated version of the Ramayana, and the Rishyasringa, often considered as works in their own right.
Traditionally, the authorship of the Mahabharata is attributed to Vyasa. There have been many attempts to unravel its historical growth and compositional layers. The oldest preserved parts of the text are not thought to be appreciably older than around 400 BCE, though the origins of the story probably fall between the 8th and 9th centuries BCE. The text probably reached its final form by the early Gupta period (ca. 4th c. CE). The title may be translated as "the great tale of the Bharata dynasty". According to the Mahabharata itself, the tale is extended from a shorter version of 24,000 verses called simply Bharata.
With about one hundred thousand verses, long prose passages, or about 1.8 million words in total, the Mahabharata is roughly ten times the length of the Iliad and Odyssey combined, or about four times the length of the Ramayana. W. J. Johnson has compared the importance of the Mahabharata to world civilization to that of the Bible, the works of Shakespeare, the works of Homer, Greek drama, and the Qur'an.

The story (part historical, part legend, and part myth) chronicles the lives of feudal lords and their retainers, who tried to replace the dwindling Han Dynasty or restore it. While the novel actually follows literally hundreds of characters, the focus is mainly on the three power blocs that emerged from the remnants of the Han Dynasty, and would eventually form the three states of Cao Wei, Shu Han, and Eastern Wu. The novel deals with the plots, personal and army battles, intrigues, and struggles of these states to achieve dominance for almost 100 years. This novel also gives readers a sense of how the Chinese view their history in a cyclical lense. The famous opening lines of the novel summarize this view: It is a general truism of this world that anything long divided will surely unite, and anything long united will surely divide.

		<English>[TAB] Emperor Shaka the Great is an epic poem based on the Zulu oral tradition, compiled in Zulu then translated by South African Poet Mazisi Kunene. The epic follows the life of Shaka Zulu. The poem documents his exploits as a king of the Zulu people, produced considerable advances in State structure and military technologies of the Zulu. Some critics express concern over the historicity of the retelling. However, Kunene's embrasure of an African perspective on Shaka's Rule expresses an attempt at understanding the apparent horrors observed by Europeans in the Shaka's history.
Though the Zulu had practised considerable oral poetry from early in the history, the Zulu heroic epic was not fully developed until the reign of Shaka. This poem represents the national tradition of recording the rule of Shaka through many official historians specializing in one particular part of Shaka's history. In Zulu tradition, the poets, izimbongis, are definers of social values and celebrators of the nation and its successes. One expert, commenting on Kunene's work, said "the oral traditions of the Zulus these are not memorized stories ... These are re-creations, re-creations in terms of the present. Kunene was masterful at that." The Culture Sector of UNESCO sanctions the book as a representative translation of Zulu literature.		(Wikipedia)</English>

The title translates as "Book of the Community," "Book of Counsel," or more literally as "Book of the People." Popol Vuh's prominent features are its creation myth, its diluvian suggestion, its epic tales of the Hero Twins Hunahp&#250; and Xbalanqu&#233;, and its genealogies. The myth begins with the exploits of anthropomorphic ancestors and concludes with a regnal genealogy, perhaps as an assertion of divine right rule.		(Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] Osman's Dream is an Old Turkish epic poem, narrative history, attributed to Osman I of the Ottoman Empire, but most probably unknown authorship, dating at the 13th century. The work alludes to a dream experienced by the first sultan, Osman I, consisting of a summary of the rise and growth of the empire four centuries before the events happened. The dream illuminates via myth some of the conditions and ambitions in existence at the dawn of the Ottoman institution.
The Ottoman writers attach great importance to this dream of the founder of their empire (Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] Paradise Lost is an epic poem in blank verse by the 17th-century English poet John Milton. It was originally published in 1667 (though written nearly ten years earlier) in ten books, with a total of over ten thousand individual lines of verse. A second edition followed in 1674, redivided into twelve books (in the manner of the division of Virgil's Aeneid) with minor revisions throughout and a note on the versification; most of the poem was written while Milton was blind, and was transcribed for him.
The poem concerns the Christian story of the Fall of Man: the temptation of Adam and Eve by the fallen angel Satan and their expulsion from the Garden of Eden. Milton's purpose, stated in Book I, is to "justify the ways of God to men" and elucidate the conflict between God's eternal foresight and free will. Although the primary event in the epic is about the Fall of Man, the character Satan serves as an anti-hero and as a prominent driving force in the plot. His depiction has fascinated critics, some of which have interpreted Paradise Lost as a poem questioning the church's power (a common theme during the English Renaissance) rather than only a description of the fall of Adam and Eve.
Milton incorporates Paganism, classical mythology, and Christianity into the poem. While Milton's principal goal in the work is to give a compelling Theodicy, he nevertheless deals with a range of topics, from marriage to politics (Milton was politically active during the time of the English Civil War). Many difficult theological issues are deliberately addressed, including fate, predestination, the Trinity, the introduction of sin and death into the world, as well as the nature of angels, fallen angels, Satan and the war in heaven. Milton draws on his knowledge of languages, and diverse sources - primarily Genesis, much of the New Testament, the deuterocanonical Book of Enoch, and other parts of the Old Testament. Milton's epic is often considered one of the greatest literary works in the English language, along with those of Shakespeare.	(Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's Faust is a tragic play in two parts: Faust. Der Trag&#246;die erster Teil (translated as: Faust: The First Part of the Tragedy) and Faust. Der Trag&#246;die zweiter Teil (Faust: The Second Part of the Tragedy). Although rarely staged in its entirety, it is the play with the largest audience numbers on German-language stages. Faust is Goethe's most famous work and considered by many to be one of the greatest works of German literature.
Goethe completed a preliminary version of Part One in 1806. The 1808 publication was followed by the revised 1828-29 edition, which was the last to be edited by Goethe himself. Prior to these appeared a partial printing in 1790 of Faust, a Fragment.
The earliest forms of the work, known as the Urfaust, were developed between 1772 and 1775; however, the details of that development are no longer entirely clear. Urfaust has twenty-two scenes, one in prose, two largely prose and the remaining 1,441 lines in rhymed verse. The manuscript is lost, but a copy was discovered in 1886.
Goethe finished writing Faust Part Two in 1831. In contrast to Faust Part One, the focus here is no longer on the soul of Faust, which has been sold to the devil, but rather on social phenomena such as psychology, history and politics, in addition to mystical and philosophical topics. The second part formed the principal occupation of Goethe's last years. It appeared only posthumously in 1832.	(Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] The Tarikh al-Sudan (also Tarikh es-Sudan - the "History of the Sudan") is a chronicle written in Arabic in around 1655 by Abd al-Sadi. It provides the single most important primary source for the history of the Songhay Empire.
The author, Abd al-Sadi, was born on 28 May 1594, and died at an unknown date sometime after 1655-56, the last date to be mentioned in his chronicle. He spent most of his life working for the Moroccan Arma bureaucracy, initially in the administration of Djenn&#233; and the massina region of the Inland Niger Delta. In 1646 he became chief secretary to the Arma administration of Timbuktu.
The early sections of the chronicle are devoted to brief histories of earlier Songhay dynasties, of the Mali Empire and of the Tuareg, and to biographies of the scholars and holymen of both Timbuktu and Djenn&#233;. The main part of the chronicle covers the history of the Songhay from the middle of the 15th century till the Moroccan invasion in 1591, and then the history of Timbuktu under Moroccan rule up to 1655. Al-Sadi rarely acknowledges his sources. For the earlier period much of his information is presumably based on oral tradition. From around 1610 the information would have been gained first hand.

		<English>[TAB] Journey to the West is one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature. It was written in the 16th century during the Ming Dynasty and attributed to Wu Cheng'en. In English-speaking countries, the work is widely known as Monkey, the title used for a popular and partial translation by Arthur Waley. 
The novel is a fictionalized account of the legendary pilgrimage to India of the Buddhist monk Xuanzang, and loosely based its source from the historic text Great Tang Records on the Western Regions and traditional folk tales. The monk travelled to the "Western Regions" during the Tang Dynasty, to obtain sacred texts (sutras). The bodhisattva Avalokitesvara (Guanyin), on instruction from the Buddha, gives this task to the monk and his three protectors in the form of disciples - namely Sun Wukong, Zhu Bajie and Sha Wujing - together with a dragon prince who acts as Xuanzang's steed, a white horse. These four characters have agreed to help Xuanzang as an atonement for past sins.
Journey to the West has a strong background in Chinese folk religion, Chinese mythology and value systems; the pantheon of Taoist immortals and Buddhist bodhisattvas is still reflective of Chinese religious beliefs today. Enduringly popular, the tale is at once an adventure story, a spring of spiritual insight, and an extended allegory in which the group of pilgrims journeying toward India represents individuals journeying towards enlightenment.

		<English>[TAB] The Book of Taliesin (Welsh: Llyfr Taliesin) is one of the most famous of Middle Welsh manuscripts, dating from the first half of the 14th century though many of the fifty-six poems it preserves are taken to originate in the 10th century. The manuscript, known as Peniarth MS 2 and kept at the National Library of Wales, is incomplete, having lost a number of its original leaves including the first. It was named Llyfr Taliessin in the 17th century by Edward Lhuyd and hence is known in English as "The Book of Taliesin".
The volume contains a collection of some of the oldest poems in Welsh, though many of them, particularly those attributed to the Dark Age poet Taliesin who was active towards the end of the 6th century, would have been composed in the Cumbric dialect of the north.
A core of praise poems of Urien Rheged is generally attributed to the historical Taliesin. The manuscript also preserves a few hymns, a small collection of elegies to famous men such as Cunedda and Dylan Eil Ton and also famous enigmatic poems such as The Battle of Trees and The Spoils of Annwfn (in which the poet claims to have sailed to another world with Arthur and his warriors). Several of these contain internal claims to be the work of Taliesin, but cannot be.
Many poems in the collection allude to Christian and Latin texts as well as native British tradition, and the book contains the earliest mention in any western vernacular literature of the feats of Hercules and Alexander the Great. (Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] The Book of Dede Korkut, also spelled as Dada Gorgud, Dede Qorqut, is the most famous epic stories of the Oghuz Turks (also known as Turkmens or Turcomans) The stories carry morals and values significant to the social lifestyle of the nomadic Turks and their pre-Islamic beliefs. The book's mythic narrative is part of the cultural heritage of Turkic states some of those are Turkey, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and as well as to a lesser degree Kyrgyzstan. 
		A series of epics orally told and transferred over the generations before published as a book. There are numerous versions collected of the stories; once were natural verses since Turkish is an agglutinative language, they gradually transformed into combinations of verse and prose as the Islamic elements emerge by the time. Various dates have been proposed for the first written copies. Geoffery Lewis dates it fairly early in the 15th century with an older substratum of these oral traditions dating to conflicts between the ancient Oghuz and their Turkish rivals in Central Asia (the Pecheneks and the Kipchaks). However, according to him, this substratum has been clothed in references to the 14th-century campaigns of the Akkoyunlu Confederation. Cemal Kafadar mentions that it was no earlier than the 15th century based on the fact that the author is buttering up both the Akkoyunlu and Ottoman ruler. Stanford Jay Shaw (1977) in his history of the Ottoman empire dates it in the 14th century. Professor Michael E. Meeker believes that the stories and songs have emerged no earlier than the beginning of the 13th century and were written down no later than the beginning of the 15th century. Some scholars in Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan place it in the 8th century[citation needed]. A precise determination is impossible to come by due to the nomadic lifestyle of the early Turkic people, where epics such as Dede Korkut were passing from generation to generation in an oral form. This is especially true of an epic book such as this, which is a product of a long series of narrators, any of whom could have made alterations and additions, right down to the two 16th-century scribes who authored the oldest extant manuscripts. The majority of scholars of ancient Turkic epics and folk tales, such as Russian-Soviet academician Vasily Bartold and British scholar Geoffrey Lewis, believe that the Dede Korkut text "exhibits a number of features characteristic of Azeri, the Turkish dialect of Azerbaijan".
The epic tales of Dede Korkut is one of the best known Turkic dastans from among a total of well over 1,000 recorded epics among the Mongolian and Turkic language families by international scholars.(Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] The Ramayana is an ancient Sanskrit epic. It is ascribed to the Hindu sage Valmiki and forms an important part of the Hindu canon (sm?ti), considered to be itihasa. The Ramayana is one of the two great epics of India, the other being the Mahabharata. It depicts the duties of relationships, portraying ideal characters like the ideal father, ideal servant, the ideal brother, the ideal wife and the ideal king.
The name Ramayana is a tatpurusha compound of Rama and ayana ("going, advancing"), translating to "Rama's Journey". The Ramayana consists of 24,000 verses in seven books and 500 cantos, and tells the story of Rama (an Avatar of the Hindu preserver-God Vishnu), whose wife Sita is abducted by the demon king of Lanka, Ravana. Thematically, the Ramayana explores human values and the concept of dharma.
Verses in the Ramayana are written in a 32-syllable meter called anustubh. The Ramayana was an important influence on later Sanskrit poetry and Indian life and culture. Like the Mahabharata, the Ramayana is not just a story: it presents the teachings of ancient Hindu sages in narrative allegory, interspersing philosophical and devotional elements. The characters Rama, Sita, Lakshmana, Bharata, Hanuman and Ravana are all fundamental to the cultural consciousness of India.	(Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] The Divine Comedy (Italian: Divina Commedia) is an epic poem written by Dante Alighieri between 1308 and his death in 1321. It is widely considered the preeminent work of Italian literature, and is seen as one of the greatest works of world literature. The poem's imaginative and allegorical vision of the afterlife is a culmination of the medieval world-view as it had developed in the Western Church. It helped establish the Tuscan dialect in which it is written as the standardized Italian. It is divided into three parts, the Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso.
On the surface, the poem describes Dante's travels through Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven; but at a deeper level, it represents allegorically the soul's journey towards God. At this deeper level, Dante draws on medieval Christian theology and philosophy, especially Thomistic philosophy and the Summa Theologica of Thomas Aquinas. Consequently, the Divine Comedy has been called "the Summa in verse.".	(Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] The Odyssey (Greek: Odysseia) is one of two major ancient Greek epic poems attributed to Homer. It is, in part, a sequel to the Iliad, the other work traditionally ascribed to Homer. The poem is fundamental to the modern Western canon. Indeed it is the second-the Iliad being the first-extant work of Western literature. It was probably composed near the end of the 8th century BC, somewhere in Ionia, the Greek coastal region of Anatolia.
The poem mainly centers on the Greek hero Odysseus (or Ulysses, as he was known in Roman myths) and his long journey home following the fall of Troy. It takes Odysseus ten years to reach Ithaca after the ten-year Trojan War. In his absence, it is assumed he has died, and his wife Penelope and son Telemachus must deal with a group of unruly suitors, the Mnesteres or Proci, competing for Penelope's hand in marriage.
It continues to be read in the Homeric Greek and translated into modern languages around the world. Many scholars believe that the original poem was composed in an oral tradition by an aoidos (epic poet/singer), perhaps a rhapsode (professional performer), and was more likely intended to be heard than read. The details of the ancient oral performance, and the story's conversion to a written work inspire continual debate among scholars. The Odyssey was written in a regionless poetic dialect of Greek and comprises 12,110 lines of dactylic hexameter. Among the most impressive elements of the text are its non-linear plot, and that events seem to depend as much on the choices made by women and serfs as on the actions of fighting men. In the English language as well as many others, the word odyssey has come to refer to an epic voyage.	(Wikipedia)</English>

It follows the lives and interactions of several French characters over a seventeen-year period in the early nineteenth century, starting in 1815 and culminating in the 1832 June Rebellion.
The novel focuses on the struggles of ex-convict Jean Valjean and his experience of redemption. It examines the nature of law and grace, and expatiates upon the history of France, architecture of Paris, politics, moral philosophy, antimonarchism, justice, religion, and the types and nature of romantic and familial love. The story is historical fiction because it contains factual and historic events. Contrary to what some believe, it does not use the French Revolution as a backdrop. The French Revolution took place in the eighteenth century; Les Miserables takes place in the nineteenth. The only "revolution" depicted is the June Rebellion, a student uprising.

		<English>[TAB]The Tale of Sinuhe is considered one of the finest works of Ancient Egyptian literature. It is a narrative set in the aftermath of the death of Pharaoh Amenemhat I, founder of the 12th dynasty of Egypt, in the early 20th century BC. It is likely that it was composed only shortly after this date, albeit the earliest extant manuscript is from the reign of Amenemhat III, ca. 1800 BC. There is an ongoing debate among Egyptologists as to whether or not the tale is based on actual events involving an individual named Sinuhe, with the consensus being that it is most likely a work of fiction. Due to the universal nature of the themes explored in Sinuhe, including divine providence and mercy, its anonymous author has been described as the "Egyptian Shakespeare" whose ideas have parallels in biblical texts. Sinuhe is considered to be a work written in verse and it may also have been performed. The great popularity of the work is witnessed by the numerous surviving fragments.	(Wikipedia)</English>

It was written for the Mongol royal family some time after Genghis Khan's death in AD 1227, by an anonymous author and probably originally in the Uyghur script, though the surviving texts all derive from transcriptions into Chinese characters dating from the end of the 14th century.
The Secret History is regarded as the single significant native Mongolian account of Genghis Khan. Linguistically, it provides the richest source of pre-classical Mongolian and Middle Mongolian.

		<English>[TAB] Throughout history, large and expensive works of art have generally been commissioned by religious institutions and monarchs and been displayed in temples, churches, and palaces. Although these collections of art were private, they were often made available for viewing for a portion of the public. In classical times, religious institutions began to function as an early form of art gallery. Wealthy Roman collectors of engraved gems (including Julius Caesar) and other precious objects often donated their collections to temples. It is unclear how easy it was in practice for the public to view these items. The art collection at the Palace of Versailles in France was periodically open for 'respectable' public viewing.
In Europe, from the Late Medieval period onwards, areas in royal palaces, castles, and large country houses of the social elite were often made partially accessible to sections of the public, where art collections could be viewed. At the Palace of Versailles, entrance was restricted to people wearing the proper apparel - the appropriate accessories (silver shoe buckles and a sword) could be hired from shops outside. The treasuries of cathedrals and large churches, or parts of them, were often set out for public display. Many of the grander English country houses could be toured by the respectable for a tip to the housekeeper, during the long periods when the family were not in residence.
In the second half of the eighteenth century, many private collections of art were nationalised and opened to the public.
In 1753, the British Museum was established and the Old Royal Library collection of manuscripts and artwork was donated to it for public viewing. In 1777, a proposal to the British government was put forward by MP John Wilkes to buy the art collection of the then late Sir Robert Walpole who had amassed one of the greatest such collections in Europe, and house it in a specially built wing of the British Museum for public viewing. After much debate, the idea was eventually abandoned due to the great expense, and twenty years later, the collection was bought by Tsarina Catherine the Great of Russia and housed in the State Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg.
The Bavarian royal collection (now in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich) was opened to the public in 1779 and the Medici collection in Florence around 1789 (as the Uffizi Gallery). The opening of the Musée du Louvre during the French Revolution in 1793 as a public museum for much of the former French royal collection marked an important stage in the development of public access to art by transferring the ownership to a republican state; but it was a continuation of trends already well established. The building now occupied by the Prado in Madrid was built before the French Revolution for the public display of parts of the royal art collection, and similar royal galleries were opened to the public in Vienna, Munich and other capitals. In Great Britain, however, the corresponding Royal Collection remained in the private hands of the monarch and the first purpose-built national art galleries were the Dulwich Picture Gallery, founded in 1814 and the National Gallery opened to the public a decade later in 1824.

At an unknown moment, its function was changed and it became a store room, probably because the Treasury had become too small to contain all treasures that were hoarded in Persepolis.

		<English>[TAB]The Sh&#226;hname, "The Book of Kings" or "The Epic of Kings", is an enormous poetic opus written by the Persian poet Ferdowsi around 1000 AD, is the national epic of the Persian speaking world. The Shahnameh tells the mythical and historical past of Iran from the creation of the world up until the Islamic conquest of Iran in the 7th century.[PARAGRAPH:1] Aside from its utmost literary importance, the Sh&#226;hnameh written in almost pure Persian, had been pivotal for reviving the Persian language subsequent to the influence of Arabic. This voluminous work, regarded by Persian speakers as a literary masterpiece, also reflects Iran's history, cultural values, its ancient religions (Zoroastrianism), and its profound sense of nationhood. Ferdowsi completed the Sh&#226;hnameh at the point in time when national independence had been compromised. While there are memorable heroes and heroines of the classical type in this work, the real, ongoing hero is Iran itself. It has been called the "Persian Quran" by Ibn al-Athir, even though this title is not common knowledge among the Persian speakers but somehow indicates the importance of this book for all Persian speakers of the Iranian world, including Afghanistan and Tajikistan, to other Persian speakers of Central Asia, as well as in India, Pakistan and as far as China. In short: a study of the Sh&#226;hnameh gives us a literary excuse for exploring how culture moves across time and space, becoming part of the global common heritage. [PARAGRAPH:2] The Sh&#226;hnameh recounts the history of Iran, beginning with the creation of the world and the introduction of the arts of civilization (fire, cooking, metallurgy, law) to the Aryans and ends with the Arab conquest of Persia. The work is not precisely chronological, but there is a general movement through time. Some of the characters live for hundreds of years (as do some of the characters in the Bible), but most have normal life spans. There are many shahs who come and go, as well as heroes and villains, who also come and go. The only lasting images are that of Greater Iran itself, and a succession of sunrises and sunsets, no two ever exactly alike, yet illustrative of the passage of time. Father Time, a Saturn-like image, is a reminder of the tragedy of death and loss, yet the next sunrise comes, bringing with it hope of a new day. In the first cycle of creation, evil is external (the devil). In the second cycle, we see the beginnings of family hatred, bad behavior, and evil permeating human nature. Shah Fereydun's two eldest sons have greed and envy toward their innocent younger brother and, thinking their father favors him, they murder him. The murdered prince's son avenges the murder, and all are immersed in the cycle of murder and revenge, blood and more blood. In the third cycle, we encounter a series of flawed shahs. There is a Phaedra-like story of Shah Kay Kaus, his wife Sudaba, and her passion and rejection by her stepson, Siyavash. In the next cycle, all the players are unsympathetic and selfish and evil. This epic on the whole is darker over all than most other epics, most of which have some sort of resolution and catharsis. This tone seems reflective of two things, perhaps: the conquest of the Persians by the Arabs, and a reflection of the last days of Persian Zoroastrianism. The old religion had been fraught with heresies, and somehow Zoroaster's optimistic view of man's ability to choose had become life denying and negative of this world. There is an enormous amount of bad luck and bad fate here. It is only in the characterizations of the work's many figures, both male and female, that Zoroaster's original view of the human condition comes through. Zoroaster emphasized human free will. We find all of Ferdowsi's characters complex. Nobody is an archetype or a puppet. The best characters have bad flaws, and the worst have moments of humanity.[PARAGRAPH:3]Some experts believe the main reason the Modern Persian language today is more or less the same language as that of Ferdowsi's time over 1000 years ago is due to the very existence of works like Ferdowsi's Sh&#226;hnameh which have had lasting and profound cultural and linguistic influence. In other words, the Sh&#226;hnameh itself has become one of the main pillars of the modern Persian language. Studying Ferdowsi's masterpiece also became a requirement for achieving mastery of the Persian language by subsequent Persian poets, as evidenced by numerous references to the Sh&#226;hnameh in their works.[PARAGRAPH:4] The Sh&#226;hnameh is one of the few original national epics in the world. Many peoples of the world have their "own" national epics, but more often than not, the original theme of such national epics are borrowed from other, usually neighbouring, cultures. This is not the case with the Sh&#226;hnameh, which is based on original Iranic stories. The Sh&#226;hnameh has 62 stories, 990 chapters, and contains 60,000 rhyming couplets, making it more than seven times the length of Homer's Iliad, and more than twelve times the length of the German Nibelungenlied. There have been a number of English translations, almost all abridged. In 1925, the brothers Arthur and Edmond Warner published the complete work in nine volumes, now out of print. And Dick Davis translation 3 Volumes 1998 - 2003 still in print.</English>

Alternatively, a federation is a form of government in which sovereign power is formally divided between a central authority and a number of constituent regions so that each region retains some degree of control over its internal affairs.

		<English>[TAB] A noria is a machine for lifting water into a small aqueduct, either for the purpose of irrigation or, in at least one known instance, to feed seawater into a saltern.
Norias were adopted during the Arab Agricultural Revolution and were in large-scale use in the medieval Islamic world, where Muslim inventors and engineers made a number of improvements to the noria. For example, the flywheel mechanism used to smooth out the delivery of power from a driving device to a driven machine, was invented by Ibn Bassal (fl. 1038-1075) of al-Andalus, who pioneered the use of the flywheel in the noria and chain pump (Sakia or saqiya). In 1206, Al-Jazari introduced the use of the crankshaft in a noria and saqiya, and the concept of minimizing intermittent working was implied for the purpose of maximising their efficiency.
Muslim engineers used norias to discharge water into aqueducts which carried the water to towns and fields. Some of the norias used in the medieval Islamic world were as large as 20 meters in diameter, the norias at Hama being a surviving example still used in modern times (although currently only serving aesthetical purposes). It has 120 water collection compartments and could raise more than 95 litres of water per minute. Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi's Kitab al-Hawi in the 10th century describes a noria in Iraq that could lift as much as 153,000 litres per hour, or 2550 litres per minute. This is comparable to the output of modern Norias in East Asia which can lift up to 288,000 litres per hour, or 4800 litres per minute.		(Wikipedia)</English>

Declared the largest statue in the world in 1967, it is the last non-religious statue to be declared the largest; every record holder since has been a Buddhism-related sculpture. Compared to the later higher statues, The Motherland Calls is significantly more complex from an engineering point of view, due to its characteristic posture with a sword raised high in the right hand and the left hand extended in a calling gesture. The technology behind the statue is based on a combination of prestressed concrete with wire ropes structure, a solution which can be found also in another work of Nikitin's, the super-tall Ostankino Tower in Moscow.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]When the memorial was dedicated in 1967 it was the tallest sculpture in the world, measuring 85 metres from the tip of its sword to the top of the plinth. The figure itself measures 52 metres, and the sword 33 metres. Two hundred steps, symbolizing the 200 days of the Battle of Stalingrad, lead from the bottom of the hill to the monument. The lead sculptor was Yevgeny Vuchetich, and the significant structural engineering challenges of the 7,900 tonnes (7,800 long tons; 8,700 short tons) of concrete sculpture were handled by Nikolai Nikitin.

		<English>[TAB] Magna Carta (Latin for "the Great Charter"), also called Magna Carta Libertatum (Latin for "the Great Charter of the Liberties"), is a charter agreed by King John of England at Runnymede, near Windsor, on 15 June 1215. First drafted by the Archbishop of Canterbury to make peace between the unpopular King and a group of rebel barons, it promised the protection of church rights, protection for the barons from illegal imprisonment, access to swift justice, and limitations on feudal payments to the Crown, to be implemented through a council of 25 barons. Neither side stood behind their commitments, and the charter was annulled by Pope Innocent III, leading to the First Barons' War. After John's death, the regency government of his young son, Henry III, reissued the document in 1216, stripped of some of its more radical content, in an unsuccessful bid to build political support for their cause. At the end of the war in 1217, it formed part of the peace treaty agreed at Lambeth, where the document acquired the name Magna Carta, to distinguish it from the smaller Charter of the Forest which was issued at the same time. Short of funds, Henry reissued the charter again in 1225 in exchange for a grant of new taxes; his son, Edward I, repeated the exercise in 1297, this time confirming it as part of England's statute law.</English>

		<English>[TAB] The Great Bath is one of the best-known structures among the ruins of the ancient Indus Valley Civilization at Mohenjo-daro in Sindh, Pakistan. Archaeological evidence indicates that the Great Bath was built in the 3rd Millennium BC, just sometime after raising of the "citadel" mound on which it is located.
The Great Bath of Mohenjodaro is called the "earliest public water tank of the ancient world". It measures 11.88 meters x 7.01 meters, and has a maximum depth of 2.43 meters. Two wide staircases, one from the north and one from the south, served as the entry to the structure. A 1 meter wide and 40 centimeters mound is present at end of these stairs.
A hole was also found at one end of the Bath which might have been used to drain the water into it. The floor of the tank was water tight due to finely fitted bricks and mud laid on edge with gypsum plaster and the side walls were constructed in a similar manner. To make the tank even more water tight, a thick layer of bitumen (waterproof tar) was laid along the sides of the pool and presumably also on the floor. Brick colonnades were discovered on the eastern, northern and southern edges. The preserved columns had stepped edges that may have held wooden screens or window frames. Two large doors lead into the complex from the south and other access was from the north and east. A series of rooms were located along the eastern edge of the building and in one room was a well that may have supplied some of the water needed to fill the tank. Rainwater also may have been collected for this purpose, but no inlet drains have been found.It had a long bathing pool built with waterproof bricks.</English>

		<English>[TAB] The Nazca Lines are a series of ancient geoglyphs located in the Nazca Desert in southern Peru. They were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994. The high, arid plateau stretches more than 80 kilometres (50 mi) between the towns of Nazca and Palpa on the Pampas de Jumana about 400 km south of Lima. Although some local geoglyphs resemble Paracas motifs, scholars believe the Nazca Lines were created by the Nazca culture between 400 and 650 AD. The hundreds of individual figures range in complexity from simple lines to stylized hummingbirds, spiders, monkeys, fish, sharks, orcas, llamas, and lizards.
The lines are shallow designs made in the ground by removing the ubiquitous reddish pebbles and uncovering the whitish ground beneath. Hundreds are simple lines or geometric shapes; more than seventy are zoomorphic designs of animals such as birds, fish, llamas, jaguar, monkey, or human figures. Other designs include phytomorphic shapes such as trees and flowers. The largest figures are over 200 metres (660 ft) across. Scholars differ in interpreting the purpose of the designs, but in general they ascribe religious significance to them.
The geometric ones could indicate the flow of water or be connected to rituals to summon water. The spiders, birds, and plants could be fertility symbols. Other possible explanations include: irrigation schemes or giant astronomical calendars.
Due to the dry, windless, and stable climate of the plateau and its isolation, for the most part the lines have been preserved. Extremely rare changes in weather may temporarily alter the general designs. (Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] Hacienda is a Spanish word for an estate. Some haciendas were plantations, mines, or even business factories. Many haciendas combined these productive activities. The hacienda system of Argentina, parts of Brazil, Chile, Mexico and New Granada was a system of large land-holdings that were an end in themselves as the marks of status (in Portuguese, the cognate term fazenda applies to the similar system in Brazil). The hacienda aimed for self-sufficiency in everything but luxuries meant for display, which were destined for the handful of people in the circle of the patr&#243;n.
Haciendas originated in land grants, mostly made to conquistadors. It is in Mexico that the hacienda system can be considered to have its origin in 1529, when the Spanish crown granted to Hern&#225;n Cort&#233;s the title of Marquess of the Valley of Oaxaca, which entailed a tract of land that included all of the present state of Morelos. Significantly, Cort&#233;s was also granted an encomienda, which included all the Native Americans then living on the land and power of life and death over every soul on his domains.

Ovoos are often found at the top of mountains and in high places, like mountain passes. They serve mainly as religious sites, used in worship of the mountains and the sky as well as in Buddhist ceremonies, but often are also landmarks. When travelling, it is custom to stop and circle an ovoo three times in clockwise direction, in order to have a safer journey. Usually, rocks are picked up from the ground and added to the pile. Also, one may leave offerings in the form of sweets, money, milk, or vodka. Ovoos are also used in mountain- and sky-worshipping ceremonies that typically take place at the end of summer. Worshippers place a tree branch or stick in the ovoo and tie a blue khadag, a ceremonial silk scarf symbolic of the open sky and the sky spirit Tengger, or Tengri, to the branch. They then light a fire and make food offerings, followed by a ceremonial dance and prayers (worshippers sitting at the northwest side of the ovoo), and a feast with the food left over from the offering.</English>

The Tonyukuk inscription, a monument situated somewhat further east, is slightly earlier, dating to c. 722.
Other inscriptions using the same script are found in Mongolia, Siberia, and Xinjiang. They relate in epic language the legendary origins of the Turks, the golden age of their history, their subjugation by the Chinese, and their liberation by Bilge.		(Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] An Health Resort or destination spa is a short term residential-lodging facility with the primary purpose of providing individual services for spa-goers to develop healthy habits. Historically many such spas were developed at the location of natural hot springs or sources of mineral waters. Typically over a seven-day stay, such facilities provide a comprehensive program that includes spa services, physical fitness activities, wellness education, healthy cuisine and special interest programming.
Some destination spas offer an all-inclusive program that includes facilitated fitness classes, healthy cuisine, educational classes and seminars as well as similar services to a beauty salon or a day spa. Guests reside and participate in the program at a destination spa instead of just visiting for a treatment or pure vacation. Some destination spas are in exotic locations or in spa towns.
Destination spas have been in use for a considerable time, and some are not used actively, but rather are historically preserved as elements of earlier history; for example, Gilroy Yamato Hot Springs in California is such a historically used spa whose peak patronage occurred in the late 19th and early 20th century.

		<English>[TAB] A Tambo (Quechua: tampu, "inn") was an Incan structure built for administrative and military purposes. Found along Incan roads, tambos typically carried supplies, served as lodging for itinerant state personnel, and were depositories of quipu-based accounting records.
Different types of tambos existed; those that served to lodge the traveling Inca and his entourage (typically wives and state officials), and those that served as relay stations for the chasquis, who were state messengers who ran along state roads.
Tambos were also planned settlements. Architecture and documentary evidence suggest that the functional sizes of the settlements probably corresponded to their capacity to house a population.
Not all modern locations called "tambo" were necessarily formal state way stations, or Inca tampu. Ostensibly, tampu were about a single day's walk apart, with major installations about every five to six days walk.
Remains of tambos are scattered throughout modern-day Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Colombia. Pedro Cieza de Leon made numerous references to the tambos in his Cronicas de Peru; in the following passage, Cieza de Leon described the general uses for the tambos that he learned from native peoples:
 And so there would be adequate supplies for their men, every four leagues there were lodgings and storehouses, and the representatives or stewards who lived in the capital of the provinces took great care to see that the natives kept these inns or lodgings (tambos) well supplied. And so certain of them would not give more than others, and all should make their contribution, they kept the accounts by a method of knots, which they call quipus, and in this way, after the troops had passed by, they could check and see that there had been no fraud.

		<English>[TAB] Sabantuy is a Tatar (and Idel-Uralian) summer festival, that dates back to the Volga Bulgarian epoch. 
		Sabantuy traces its origins to the pre-Islamic epoch, when it was celebrated before the sowing season. The presence of Sabantuy was noticed by ibn Fadlan as early as in 921. Traditional songs and other customs of the Sabantuy probably had a religious connotation at that time.
Later, with the spread of Islam among Tatars and Bashkirs and Christianity among Chuvashs, it became a secular holiday. In each region, villages took turns to celebrate the holiday.
In the beginning of the 20th century Sabantuy gained recognition as the national festival of the Tatars. The Soviet authorities approved of this festival probably due to its humble rural origin. However, they moved Sabantuy to the after-sowing season, thus merging it with the ancient summer festival.
Recently, Moscow announced plans to nominate Sabantuy for the inclusion into the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity list in 2007.(Wikipedia)</English>

Stock exchanges also provide facilities for issue and redemption of securities and other financial instruments, and capital events including the payment of income and dividends. Securities traded on a stock exchange include shares issued by companies, unit trusts, derivatives, pooled investment products and bonds.
To be able to trade a security on a certain stock exchange, it must be listed there. Usually, there is a central location at least for record keeping, but trade is increasingly less linked to such a physical place, as modern markets are electronic networks, which gives them advantages of increased speed and reduced cost of transactions. Trade on an exchange is by members only.
The initial offering of stocks and bonds to investors is by definition done in the primary market and subsequent trading is done in the secondary market. A stock exchange is often the most important component of a stock market. Supply and demand in stock markets are driven by various factors that, as in all free markets, affect the price of stocks (see stock valuation).
There is usually no compulsion to issue stock via the stock exchange itself, nor must stock be subsequently traded on the exchange. Such trading is said to be off exchange or over-the-counter. This is the usual way that derivatives and bonds are traded. Increasingly, stock exchanges are part of a global market for securities. (Wikipedia)</English>

Public basilicas began to appear in Hellenistic cities in the 2nd century BC.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Roman basilica was a large roofed hall erected for transacting business and disposing of legal matters. As early as the time of Augustus, a public basilica for transacting business had been part of any settlement that considered itself a city, used in the same way as the late mediaeval covered market houses of northern Europe, where the meeting room, for lack of urban space, was set above the arcades, however. Although their form was variable, basilicas often contained interior colonnades that divided the space, giving aisles or arcaded spaces on one or both sides, with an apse at one end (or less often at each end), where the magistrates sat, often on a slightly raised dais. The central aisle tended to be wide and was higher than the flanking aisles, so that light could penetrate through the clerestory windows.[PARAGRAPH:2]The oldest known basilica, the Basilica Porcia, was built in Rome in 184 BC by Cato the Elder during the time he was Censor.

		<English>[TAB] Jewellery is a personal ornament, such as a necklace, ring, or bracelet, made from jewels, precious metals or other substance.
The word jewellery is derived from the word jewel, which was anglicised from the Old French "jouel" in around the 13th century. Further tracing leads back to the Latin word "jocale", meaning plaything. Jewellery is one of the oldest forms of body adornment; recently found 100,000 year-old Nassarius shells that were made into beads are thought to be the oldest known jewellery.
Although in earlier times jewellery was created for more practical uses, such as wealth storage and pinning clothes together, in recent times it has been used almost exclusively for decoration. The first pieces of jewellery were made from natural materials, such as bone, animal teeth, shell, wood, and carved stone. Jewellery was often made for people of high importance to show their status and, in many cases, they were buried with it.
Jewellery is made out of almost every material known and has been made to adorn nearly every body part, from hairpins to toe rings and many more types of jewellery. While high-quality and artistic pieces are made with gemstones and precious metals, less-costly costume jewellery is made from less-valuable materials and is mass-produced. New variations include wire sculpture (wrap) jewellery, using anything from base metal wire with rock tumbled stone to precious metals and precious gemstones. (Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] A trading post (or trading fort) was a place or establishment where the trading of goods took place. Trading posts were also places for people to meet and exchange the news of the world or simply the news from their home country (many of the world's trading posts were located in places which were popular destinations for emigration) in a time when not even newspapers existed.
Trading posts in general were of great importance to the history of currency. Though barter has been used for millennia and continues to be used, almost from the start of trading post history, the need occurred to have something as a payment medium. Soon trade tokens and eventually coins were produced from precious metals like gold, silver and copper for the use of buying and selling goods instead of simply exchanging them. After the introduction of currency, the first banks occurred in Genoa and Venice almost immediately.(Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] A longphort (Ir. plur. longphuirt) is a term used in Ireland for a Viking ship enclosure or shore fortress. Although it can be assumed that the longphorts were used as bases for Viking raids, it is clear that the term had multiple meanings and that these sites had multiple purposes. The reason it cannot be assumed that longphorts were solely for military purposes is that would assume that there were always large numbers of Vikings at these settlements, which is not true. These camps were fortified areas along rivers, usually at a tributary where both sides were protected such that the Vikings could port ships. The sites were easily defended, sheltered, and gave immediate access to the sea. These camps would be of great importance to the Vikings during their raids of Ireland, which included attacks on many churches and monasteries located on the coast of Ireland. It can be assumed that the purpose of these sights were to ease travel and trade within the region. Longphorts were essential to the economic prosperity of the Vikings. For example, it is clear that the earliest settlements became major trading centers throughout Ireland. Archeological evidence shows that imports and exports included textiles, animal skins, amber, and glass from England. During this time, the Vikings were able to begin a period of extremely profitable trade. Overall, the longphort settlements was essential in establishing the presence of the Vikings in Ireland during the ninth and tenth centuries. (Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] An inuksuk is a stone landmark or cairn built by humans, used by the Inuit, Inupiat, Kalaallit, Yupik, and other peoples of the Arctic region of North America. These structures are found from Alaska to Greenland. This region, above the Arctic Circle, is dominated by the tundra biome and has areas with few natural landmarks.
The inuksuk may have been used for navigation, as a point of reference, a marker for travel routes, fishing places, camps, hunting grounds, places of veneration, drift fences used in hunting or as a food cache. The Inupiat in northern Alaska used inuksuit to assist in the herding of caribou into contained areas for slaughter. Varying in shape and size, the inuksuit have longtime roots in the Inuit culture.
Historically, the most common type of inuksuk is a single stone positioned in an upright manner. There is some debate as to whether the appearance of human- or cross-shaped cairns developed in the Inuit culture before the arrival of European missionaries and explorers. The size of some innaguait suggest that the construction was often a communal effort.
At Enukso Point on Baffin Island, there are over 100 inuksuit. The site was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1969. (Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] Borobudur is a 9th-century Mahayana Buddhist monument in Magelang, Central Java, Indonesia. The monument consists of six square platforms topped by three circular platforms, and is decorated with 2,672 relief panels and 504 Buddha statues. A main dome, located at the center of the top platform, is surrounded by 72 Buddha statues seated inside a perforated stupa.
Built in the 9th century during the reign of the Sailendra Dynasty, the temple's design in Gupta architecture reflects India's influence on the region, yet there are enough indigenous scenes and elements incorporated to make Borobudur uniquely Indonesian. The monument is both a shrine to the Lord Buddha and a place for Buddhist pilgrimage. The journey for pilgrims begins at the base of the monument and follows a path around the monument and ascends to the top through three levels symbolic of Buddhist cosmology: Kamadhatu (the world of desire), Rupadhatu (the world of forms) and Arupadhatu (the world of formlessness). The monument guides pilgrims through an extensive system of stairways and corridors with 1,460 narrative relief panels on the walls and the balustrades.
Evidence suggest Borobudur was constructed in the 9th century and abandoned following the 14th century decline of Buddhist and Hindu kingdoms in Java, and the Javanese conversion to Islam. Worldwide knowledge of its existence was sparked in 1814 by Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, then the British ruler of Java, who was advised of its location by native Indonesians. Borobudur has since been preserved through several restorations. The largest restoration project was undertaken between 1975 and 1982 by the Indonesian government and UNESCO, following which the monument was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Borobudur is still used for pilgrimage; once a year Buddhists in Indonesia celebrate Vesak at the monument, and Borobudur is Indonesia's single most visited tourist attraction.(Wikipedia)</English>

It includes major art movements and periods, national and regional art, genres, revivals, the artists crafts, and the artists themselves.
Art historians attempt to classify medieval art into major periods and styles, often with some difficulty. A generally accepted scheme includes Early Christian art, Migration Period art, Byzantine art, Insular art, Pre-Romanesque and Romanesque art, and Gothic art, as well as many other periods within these central styles. In addition each region, mostly during the period in the process of becoming nations or cultures, had its own distinct artistic style, such as Anglo-Saxon art or Norse art.
Medieval art was produced in many media, and the works that remain in large numbers include sculpture, illuminated manuscripts, stained glass, metalwork and mosaics, all of which have had a higher survival rate than other media like fresco wall-paintings, work in precious metals or textiles, including tapestry. Especially in the early part of the period, works in the so-called "minor arts" or decorative arts, such as metalwork, ivory carving, enamel and embroidery using precious metals, were probably more highly valued than paintings or monumental sculpture.

Renaissance art, perceived as a "rebirth" of ancient traditions, took as its foundation the art of Classical antiquity, but transformed that tradition by the absorption of recent developments in the art of Northern Europe and by application of contemporary scientific knowledge. Renaissance art, with Renaissance Humanist philosophy, spread throughout Europe, affecting both artists and their patrons with the development of new techniques and new artistic sensibilities.

Partly a reaction to the Industrial Revolution, it was also a revolt against aristocratic social and political norms of the Age of Enlightenment and a reaction against the scientific rationalization of nature. It was embodied most strongly in the visual arts, music, and literature, but had a major impact on historiography, education and the natural sciences. Its effect on politics was considerable and complex; while for much of the peak Romantic period it was associated with liberalism and radicalism, in the long term its effect on the growth of nationalism was probably more significant.(Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] Realism in the arts may be generally defined as the attempt to represent subject matter truthfully, without artificiality and avoiding artistic conventions, implausible, exotic and supernatural elements.
In its most specific sense, Realism was an artistic movement that began in France in the 1850s, after the 1848 Revolution. Realists rejected Romanticism, which had dominated French literature and art since the late 18th century. Realism revolted against the exotic subject matter and exaggerated emotionalism and drama of the Romantic movement. Instead it sought to portray real and typical contemporary people and situations with truth and accuracy, and not avoiding unpleasant or sordid aspects of life. Realist works depicted people of all classes in situations that arise in ordinary life, and often reflected the changes wrought by the Industrial and Commercial Revolutions. The popularity of such 'realistic' works grew with the introduction of photography - a new visual source that created a desire for people to produce representations which look "objectively real."(Wikipedia)</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_BUILDING_ART_IMPRESSIONISM_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB] Impressionism is a 19th-century art movement that originated with a group of Paris-based artists. Their independent exhibitions brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s, in spite of harsh opposition from the conventional art community in France. The name of the style derives from the title of a Claude Monet work, Impression, soleil levant (Impression, Sunrise), which provoked the critic Louis Leroy to coin the term in a satirical review published in the Parisian newspaper Le Charivari.
Impressionist painting characteristics include relatively small, thin, yet visible brush strokes, open composition, emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities (often accentuating the effects of the passage of time), ordinary subject matter, inclusion of movement as a crucial element of human perception and experience, and unusual visual angles. The development of Impressionism in the visual arts was soon followed by analogous styles in other media that became known as impressionist music and impressionist literature.(Wikipedia)</English>

Post-Impressionists extended Impressionism while rejecting its limitations: they continued using vivid colours, thick application of paint, distinctive brush strokes, and real-life subject matter, but they were more inclined to emphasize geometric forms, to distort form for expressive effect, and to use unnatural or arbitrary colour.(Wikipedia)</English>

It dates from the 6th century BC and was discovered in the ruins of Babylon in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) in 1879. It is currently in the possession of the British Museum, which sponsored the expedition that discovered the cylinder. It was created and used as a foundation deposit following the Persian conquest of Babylon in 539 BC, when the Neo-Babylonian Empire was invaded by Cyrus and incorporated into his Persian Empire.
The text on the Cylinder praises Cyrus, sets out his genealogy and portrays him as a king from a line of kings. The Babylonian king Nabonidus, who was defeated and deposed by Cyrus, is denounced as an impious oppressor of the people of Babylonia and his low-born origins are implicitly contrasted to Cyrus's kingly heritage. The victorious Cyrus is portrayed as having been chosen by the chief Babylonian god Marduk to restore peace and order to the Babylonians. The text states that Cyrus was welcomed by the people of Babylon as their new ruler and entered the city in peace. It appeals to Marduk to protect and help Cyrus and his son Cambyses. It extols Cyrus as a benefactor of the citizens of Babylonia who improved their lives, repatriated displaced people and restored temples and cult sanctuaries across Mesopotamia and elsewhere in the region. It concludes with a description of how Cyrus repaired the city wall of Babylon and found a similar inscription placed there by an earlier king.(Wikipedia)</English>

It is located near Lake Titicaca at about 3,825 m above sea level near La Paz, Bolivia. The object is approximately 9.8 ft (3.0 m) tall and 13 ft (4.0 m) wide, and is constructed from a single piece of stone. The weight is estimated to be 10 tons. When rediscovered by European explorers in the mid-19th century, the megalith was lying horizontally and had a large crack going through it. It currently stands in the same location where it was found, although it is believed that this is not its original location, which remains uncertain.
The Gate of the Sun is a valuable monument to the history of art and ancient architecture. Some elements of Tiwanaku iconography spread throughout Peru and parts of Bolivia. Although there have been various modern interpretations of the mysterious inscriptions found on the object, the engravings that decorate the gate are believed to possess astronomical and/or astrological significance and may have served a calendrical purpose.

		<English>[TAB] The Diskobolus of Myron is a Greek sculpture that was completed towards the end of the Severe period, circa 460-450 BC. The original Greek bronze is lost but the work is known through numerous Roman copies, both full-scale ones in marble, which was cheaper than bronze, such as the first to be recovered, the Palombara Discopolus, or smaller scaled versions in bronze.
A discus thrower is depicted about to release his throw: "by sheer intelligence", Kenneth Clark observed in The Nude, "Myron has created the enduring pattern of athletic energy. He has taken a moment of action so transitory that students of athletics still debate if it is feasible, and he has given it the completeness of a cameo." The moment thus captured in the statue is an example of rhythmos, harmony and balance. Myron is often credited with being the first sculptor to master this style. Naturally, as always in Greek athletics, the Discobolus is completely nude. His pose is said to be unnatural to a human, and today considered a rather inefficient way to throw the discus. Also there is very little emotion shown in the discus thrower's face, and "to a modern eye, it may seem that Myron's desire for perfection has made him suppress too rigorously the sense of strain in the individual muscles," Clark observes. The other trademark of Myron embodied in this sculpture is how well the body is proportioned, the symmetria.
The potential energy expressed in this sculpture's tightly-wound pose, expressing the moment of stasis just before the release, is an example of the advancement of Classical sculpture from Archaic. The torso shows no muscular strain, however, even though the limbs are outflung. (Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] One Thousand and One Nights is a collection of West and South Asian stories and folk tales compiled in Arabic during the Islamic Golden Age. It is often known in English as the Arabian Nights, from the first English language edition (1706), which rendered the title as The Arabian Nights' Entertainment.
The work was collected over many centuries by various authors, translators, and scholars across West, Central, South Asia and North Africa. The tales themselves trace their roots back to ancient and medieval Arabic, Persian, Indian, Egyptian and Mesopotamian folklore and literature. In particular, many tales were originally folk stories from the Caliphate era, while others, especially the frame story, are most probably drawn from the Pahlavi Persian work Hazar Afsan which in turn relied partly on Indian elements.
What is common throughout all the editions of the Nights is the initial frame story of the ruler Shahryar and his wife Scheherazade and the framing device incorporated throughout the tales themselves. The stories proceed from this original tale; some are framed within other tales, while others begin and end of their own accord. Some editions contain only a few hundred nights, while others include 1,001 or more.
Some of the stories of The Nights, particularly "Aladdin's Wonderful Lamp", "Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves" and "The Seven Voyages of Sinbad the Sailor", while almost certainly genuine Middle Eastern folk tales, were not part of The Nights in Arabic versions, but were added into the collection by Antoine Galland and other European translators. The innovative and rich poetry and poetic speeches, chants, songs, lamentations, hymns, beseeching, praising, pleading, riddles and annotations provided by Scheherazade or her story characters are unique to the Arabic version of the book. Some are as short as one line, while others go for tens of lines. (Wikipedia)</English>

The statue represents the Biblical hero David, a favoured subject in the art of Florence. Originally commissioned as one of a series of statues of prophets to be positioned along the roofline of the east end of Florence Cathedral, the statue was instead placed in a public square, outside the Palazzo della Signoria, the seat of civic government in Florence, where it was unveiled on 8 September 1504.
Because of the nature of the hero that it represented, it soon came to symbolize the defense of civil liberties embodied in the Florentine Republic, an independent city-state threatened on all sides by more powerful rival states and by the hegemony of the Medici family. The eyes of David, with a warning glare, were turned towards Rome. The statue was moved to the Accademia Gallery in Florence in 1873, and later replaced at the original location by a replica.

		<English>[TAB] The Voynich manuscript, described as "the world's most mysterious manuscript", is a work carbon-dated to the early 15th century (1404-1438), possibly from northern Italy. It is named after the book dealer Wilfrid Voynich, who purchased it in 1912.
Some pages are missing, but there are now about 240 vellum pages, most with illustrations. Much of the manuscript resembles herbal manuscripts of the 1500s, seeming to present illustrations and information about plants and their possible uses for medical purposes. However, most of the plants do not match known species, and the manuscript's script and language remain unknown, possibly some form of ciphertext.
The Voynich manuscript has been studied by many professional and amateur cryptographers, including American and British codebreakers from both World War I and World War II. It has defied all decipherment attempts, becoming a famous case of historical cryptology. The mystery surrounding it has excited the popular imagination, making the manuscript a subject of both fanciful theories and novels. None of the many speculative solutions proposed over the last hundred years has yet been independently verified.
The Voynich manuscript was donated to Yale University's Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library in 1969, where it is catalogued under call number MS 408 and called a "Cipher Manuscript". (Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] Militia Company of District II under the Command of Captain Frans Banninck Cocq, also known as The Shooting Company of Frans Banning Cocq and Willem van Ruytenburch, but commonly referred to as The Night Watch (Dutch: De Nachtwacht), is a 1642 painting by Rembrandt van Rijn. It is in the collection of the Amsterdam Museum but is prominently displayed in the Rijksmuseum as the best-known painting in its collection. The Night Watch is one of the most famous Dutch Golden Age paintings.
[TAB] The painting is famous for three things: its colossal size (363 by 437 centimetres), the dramatic use of light and shadow (tenebrism) and the perception of motion in what would have traditionally been a static military group portrait. The painting was completed in 1642, at the peak of the Dutch Golden Age. It depicts the eponymous company moving out, led by Captain Frans Banninck Cocq (dressed in black, with a red sash) and his lieutenant, Willem van Ruytenburch (dressed in yellow, with a white sash). With effective use of sunlight and shade, Rembrandt leads the eye to the three most important characters among the crowd: the two men in the centre (from whom the painting gets its original title), and the woman in the centre-left background carrying a chicken. Behind them, the company's colours are carried by the ensign, Jan Visscher Cornelissen. The figures are almost life-size.
[TAB] Rembrandt has displayed the traditional emblem of the arquebusiers in a natural way, with the woman in the background carrying the main symbols. She is a kind of mascot herself; the claws of a dead chicken on her belt represent the clauweniers (arquebusiers), the pistol behind the chicken represents clover and she is holding the militia's goblet. The man in front of her is wearing a helmet with an oak leaf, a traditional motif of the arquebusiers. The dead chicken is also meant to represent a defeated adversary. The colour yellow is often associated with victory. (Wikipedia)</English>

The diamond has belonged to many dynasties, including Kakatiyas[citation needed], Rajputs, Mughal, Afsharid, Durrani Empires, Sikh and British who seized it as a spoil of war time and time again.
In 1850, the diamond was confiscated from Duleep Singh by the British East India Company and became part of the British Crown Jewels when Queen Victoria was proclaimed Empress of India in 1877. The diamond was traditionally known as Syamantaka-mani and later Madnayak or the "King of Jewels", before being renamed "Kuh-e nur" in the 18th century by Nadir Shah after his conquest of India. The diamond is currently set into the Crown of Queen Elizabeth and is on display at the Tower of London. (Wikipedia)</English>

The works are based loosely on characters from the Norse sagas and the Nibelungenlied. The operas, which the composer described as a trilogy with a Vorabend ("ante-evening"), are often referred to as the Ring cycle, Wagner's Ring, or simply the Ring.
Wagner wrote the libretto and music over the course of about twenty-six years, from 1848 to 1874. The four operas that constitute the Ring cycle are, in sequence:
 Das Rheingold (The Rhine Gold)
 Die Walk&#252;re (The Valkyrie)
 Siegfried
 G&#246;tterd&#228;mmerung (Twilight of the Gods)
Although individual operas of the sequence are sometimes performed separately, Wagner intended them to be performed in series. (Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] Quo Vadis: A Narrative of the Time of Nero, commonly known as Quo Vadis, is a historical novel written by Henryk Sienkiewicz in Polish. "Quo vadis Domine" is Latin for "Where are you going, Lord?" and alludes to the apocryphal Acts of Peter, in which Peter flees Rome but on his way meets Jesus and asks him why he is going to Rome. Jesus says "I am going back to be crucified again", which makes Peter go back to Rome and accept martyrdom.
The novel Quo Vadis tells of a love that develops between a young Christian woman, Ligia (or Lygia), and Marcus Vinicius, a Roman patrician. It takes place in the city of Rome under the rule of emperor Nero around AD 64.
Sienkiewicz studied the Roman Empire extensively prior to writing the novel, with the aim of getting historical details correct. As such, several historical figures appear in the book. As a whole, the novel carries an outspoken pro-Christian message.
Published in installments in three Polish dailies in 1895, it came out in book form in 1896 and has since been translated into more than 50 languages. This novel contributed to Sienkiewicz's Nobel Prize for literature in 1905.
Several movies have been based on Quo Vadis including the 1925 Italian silent film Quo Vadis, the 1951 Hollywood production Quo Vadis and the 2001 adaptation by Jerzy Kawalerowicz. (Wikipedia)</English>

It was first published in the literary journal The Russian Messenger in twelve monthly installments during 1866. It was later published in a single volume. This is the second of Dostoyevsky's full-length novels following his return from ten years of exile in Siberia. Crime and Punishment is the first great novel of his "mature" period of writing.
Crime and Punishment focuses on the mental anguish and moral dilemmas of Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished ex-student in St. Petersburg who formulates and executes a plan to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker for her cash. Raskolnikov argues that with the pawnbroker's money he can perform good deeds to counterbalance the crime, while ridding the world of a worthless vermin. He also commits this murder to test his own hypothesis that some people are naturally capable of such things, and even have the right to do them. Several times throughout the novel, Raskolnikov justifies his actions by connecting himself mentally with Napoleon Bonaparte, believing that murder is permissible in pursuit of a higher purpose.

		<English>[TAB] Tosca is an opera in three acts by Giacomo Puccini to an Italian libretto by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa. It premiered at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome on 14 January 1900. The work, based on Victorien Sardou's 1887 French-language dramatic play, La Tosca, is a melodramatic piece set in Rome in June 1800, with the Kingdom of Naples's control of Rome threatened by Napoleon's invasion of Italy. It contains depictions of torture, murder and suicide, yet also includes some of Puccini's best-known lyrical arias, and has inspired memorable performances from many of opera's leading singers.
Puccini saw Sardou's play when it was touring Italy in 1889 and, after some vacillation, obtained the rights to turn the work into an opera in 1895. Turning the wordy French play into a succinct Italian opera took four years, during which the composer repeatedly argued with his librettists and publisher. Tosca premiered at a time of unrest in Rome, and its first performance was delayed for a day for fear of disturbances. Despite indifferent reviews from the critics, the opera was an immediate success with the public.
Musically, Tosca is structured as a through-composed work, with arias, recitative, choruses and other elements musically woven into a seamless whole. Puccini used Wagnerian leitmotifs (short musical statements) to identify characters, objects and ideas. While critics have frequently dismissed the opera as a facile melodrama with confusions of plot-musicologist Joseph Kerman famously called it a "shabby little shocker"-the power of its score and the inventiveness of its orchestration have been widely acknowledged. The dramatic force of Tosca and its characters continues to fascinate both performers and audiences, and the work remains one of the most frequently performed operas. Many recordings of the work have been issued, both of studio and live performances. (Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] Carlos Schwabe (July 21, 1866 - 22 January 1926) was a German Symbolist painter and printmaker.
[TAB] Schwabe was born in Altona, Holstein, and moved to Geneva, Switzerland at an early age. After studying art in Geneva, he relocated to Paris as a young man, where he worked as a wallpaper designer, and he became acquainted with Symbolist artists. Two distinct styles are recognized in his art. Before 1900, Schwabe's paintings were more individual and experimental, indicating the idealism of the Symbolists; conventional, allegorical scenes from nature became more prominent in his later work. Images of women were important, sometimes representing death and suffering, other times creativity and guidance. His first wife was his model for angels and virgins, and "Death" in The Death of the Grave-Digger (1895) resembles her. The death of a close friend in 1894, when Schwabe was 28 years old, engendered his interest in representing death. 
[TAB] Schwabe has used the positions of the human body to tell the story. Each pose contains a great deal of information.The tension depicted in the hands of the grave digger reveal that he has been caught off guard by this angel of death. However his face expresses acceptance, rather than horror. The pose of the angel is statuesque and emotionless, creating a greater feeling of inevitability. Her delicate stance reveals movements that are not sudden, there is a calm, peaceful nature to her approach. She holds a green light within one hand, symbolizing power, yet her other hand is empty. His time has come. Her dark wings reveal her purpose, before an act takes place. He has reached the winter of his life, and is surrounded by the white snow. (Wikipedia, Arthur.io)</English>

Moulin Rouge is best known as the spiritual birthplace of the modern form of the can-can dance. Originally introduced as a seductive dance by the courtesans who operated from the site, the can-can dance revue evolved into a form of entertainment of its own and led to the introduction of cabarets across Europe.

Guernica shows the tragedies of war and the suffering it inflicts upon individuals, particularly innocent civilians. This work has gained a monumental status, becoming a perpetual reminder of the tragedies of war, an anti-war symbol, and an embodiment of peace. Upon completion, Guernica was displayed around the world in a brief tour, becoming famous and widely acclaimed. This tour helped bring the Spanish Civil War to the world's attention.
Although mention is frequently made of the painting's "return" to Spain, this is not in fact correct. Guernica was painted in Paris, where it was first exhibited, before being placed in the care of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), as it was Picasso's express desire that the painting should not be delivered to Spain until liberty and democracy had been re-established in the country. On its arrival in Spain, in September 1981, it was first displayed behind bomb-and bullet-proof glass screens at the Cas&#243;n del Buen Retiro in Madrid in time to celebrate the centenary of Picasso's birth, October 24. The exhibition was visited by almost a million people in the first year. Guernica was moved to its current permanent location in a purpose-built gallery at the Museo Reina Sof&#237;a in 1992.(Wikipedia)</English>

The film takes place in 1587 during the Warring States Period of Japan. It follows the story of a village of farmers that hire seven masterless samurai (ronin) to combat bandits who will return after the harvest to steal their crops.
Seven Samurai is described as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made, and is one of a select few Japanese films to become widely known in the West for an extended period of time. It is the subject of both popular and critical acclaim; it was voted onto the top three of the Sight and Sound critics' list of greatest films of all time in 1982, and onto the directors' top ten films lists in the 1992 and 2002 polls.(Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] One Hundred Years of Solitude is a 1967 novel by Colombian author Gabriel García Márquez that tells the multi-generational story of the Buendía family, whose patriarch, José Arcadio Buendía, founded the fictitious town of Macondo. The novel is often cited as one of the supreme achievements in world literature.
[TAB] The magical realist style and thematic substance of One Hundred Years of Solitude established it as an important representative novel of the literary Latin American Boom of the 1960s and 1970s, which was stylistically influenced by Modernism (European and North American) and the Cuban Vanguardia (Avant-Garde) literary movement.
[TAB] Since it was first published in May 1967 in Buenos Aires by Editorial Sudamericana, One Hundred Years of Solitude has been translated into 46 languages and sold more than 50 million copies. The novel, considered García Márquez's magnum opus, remains widely acclaimed and is recognized as one of the most significant works both in the Hispanic literary canon and in world literature.(Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] The Wall is the eleventh studio album by the English progressive rock group Pink Floyd. Released as a double album on 30 November 1979, it was subsequently performed live with elaborate theatrical effects, and adapted into a feature film, Pink Floyd-The Wall.
As with the band's previous three LPs, The Wall is a concept album and deals largely with themes of abandonment and personal isolation. It was first conceived during their 1977 In the Flesh Tour, when bassist and lyricist Roger Waters's frustration with the spectators' perceived boorishness became so acute that he imagined building a wall between the performers and audience. The album is a rock opera that centres on Pink, a character Waters modelled after himself, with some aspects based on the band's original leader, Syd Barrett. Pink's life experiences begin with the loss of his father during the Second World War, and continue with ridicule and abuse from his schoolteachers, an overprotective mother and finally, the breakdown of his marriage. All contribute to his eventual self-imposed isolation from society, represented by a metaphorical wall.
The Wall features a notably harsher and more theatrical style than Pink Floyd's previous releases. Keyboardist Richard Wright left the band during the album's production but remained as a salaried musician, performing with Pink Floyd during The Wall Tour. Commercially successful upon its release, the album was one of the best selling of 1980, and as of 1999, it had sold over 23 million RIAA certified units (11.5 million albums) in the United States. Rolling Stone magazine placed The Wall at number 87 on its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.(Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] Division of labour is the specialisation of cooperative labour in specific, circumscribed tasks and roles, intended to increase efficiency of output. Historically the growth of a more and more complex division of labour is closely associated with the growth of trade, the rise of capitalism, and of the complexity of industrialisation processes. Later, the division of labour reached the level of a scientifically-based management practice with the time and motion studies associated with Taylorism.
In the first sentence of An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776), Adam Smith foresaw the essence of industrialism by determining that division of labour represents a qualitative increase in productivity. His example was the making of pins. Unlike Plato, Smith did not regard the division of labour as a consequence of human inequality but famously argued that the difference between a street porter and a philosopher was as much a consequence of the division of labour as its cause. Therefore, while for Plato the level of specialisation determined by the division of labour was externally determined, for Smith it was the dynamic engine of economic progress. However, in a further chapter of the same book Smith criticises the division of labour saying it leads to a 'mental mutilation' in workers; they become ignorant and insular as their working lives are confined to a single repetitive task. The contradiction has led to some debate over Smith's opinion of the division of labour.
The specialisation and concentration of the workers on their single subtasks often leads to greater skill and greater productivity on their particular subtasks than would be achieved by the same number of workers each carrying out the original broad task.
Smith saw the importance of matching skills with equipment - usually in the context of an organisation. For example, pin makers were organised with one making the head, another the body, each using different equipment. Similarly he emphasised that a large number of skills, used in cooperation and with suitable equipment, were required to build a ship. (Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB]A steel mill (British English and Australian English steelworks) is an industrial plant for the manufacture of steel.
Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon. It is produced in a two stage process. First, the iron ore is reduced or smelted with coke and limestone in a blast furnace, producing molten iron which is either cast into pig iron or carried to the next stage as molten iron. In the second stage, known as steelmaking, impurities such as sulfur, phosphorus, and excess carbon are removed and alloying elements such as manganese, nickel, chromium and vanadium added to produce the exact steel required.
Steel mills turn molten steel into blooms, ingots, slabs and sheet through casting, hot rolling and cold rolling. (Wikipedia)

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_BUILDING_FORTIFIED_KEEP_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB] A keep (from the Middle English kype) is a type of fortified tower built within castles during the Middle Ages by European nobility. Scholars have debated the scope of the word keep, but usually consider it to refer to large towers in castles that were fortified residences, used as a refuge of last resort should the rest of the castle fall to an adversary. The first keeps were made of timber and formed a key part of the motte and bailey castles that emerged in Normandy and Anjou during the 10th century; the design spread to England as a result of the Norman invasion of 1066, and in turn spread into Wales during the second half of the 11th century and into Ireland in the 1170s. The Anglo-Normans and French rulers began to build stone keeps during the 10th and 11th centuries; these included Norman keeps, with a square or rectangular design, and circular shell keeps. Stone keeps carried considerable political as well as military importance and could take up to a decade to build.
During the 12th century new designs began to be introduced - in France, quatrefoil-shaped keeps were introduced, while in England polygonal towers were built. By the end of the century, French and English keep designs began to diverge: Philip II of France built a sequence of circular keeps as part of his bid to stamp his royal authority on his new territories, while in England castles were built that abandoned the use of keeps altogether. In Spain, keeps were increasingly incorporated into both Christian and Islamic castles, although in Germany tall towers called Bergfriede were preferred to keeps in the western fashion. In the second half of the 14th century there was a resurgence in the building of keeps. In France, the keep at Vincennes began a fashion for tall, heavily machicolated designs, a trend adopted in Spain most prominently through the Valladolid school of Spanish castle design. Meanwhile, in England tower keeps became popular amongst the most wealthy nobles: these large keeps, each uniquely designed, formed part of the grandest castles built during the period.
By the 16th century, however, keeps were slowly falling out of fashion as fortifications and residences. Many were destroyed between the 17th and 18th centuries in civil wars, or incorporated into gardens as an alternative to follies. During the 19th century, keeps became fashionable once again and in England and France a number were restored or redesigned by Gothic architects. Despite further damage to many French and Spanish keeps during the wars of the 20th century, keeps now form an important part of the tourist and heritage industry in Europe. (Wikipedia)</English>

The five-volume work describes many drugs known to be effective, including aconite, aloes, colocynth, colchicum, henbane, opium and squill. In all, about 600 plants are covered, along with some animals and mineral substances, and around 1000 medicines made from them.
The work was written between 50 and 70 AD by Pedanius Dioscorides, a Roman physician of Greek origin. It was widely read for more than 1,500 years until supplanted by revised herbals in the Renaissance, making it one of the longest-lasting of all natural history books.
De Materia Medica was circulated as illustrated manuscripts, copied by hand, in Greek, Latin and Arabic throughout the mediaeval period. From the sixteenth century on, Dioscorides' text was translated into Italian, German, Spanish, and French, and in 1655 into English. It formed the basis for herbals in these languages by men such as Leonhart Fuchs, Valerius Cordus, Lobelius, Rembert Dodoens, Carolus Clusius, John Gerard and William Turner. Gradually such herbals included more and more direct observations, supplementing and eventually supplanting the classical text.

Theophrastus looks at plant structure, reproduction and growth; the varieties of plant around the world; wood; wild and cultivated plants; and their uses. Book 9 in particular, on the medicinal uses of plants, is one of the first herbals, describing juices, gums and resins extracted from plants, and how to gather them.
Historia Plantarum was written some time between c. 350 BC and c. 287 BC in ten volumes, of which nine survive. In the book, Theophrastus described plants by their uses, and attempted a biological classification based on how plants reproduced, a first in the history of botany. He continually revised the manuscript, and it remained in an unfinished state on his death. The condensed style of the text, with its many lists of examples, indicate that Theophrastus used the manuscript as the working notes for lectures to his students, rather than intending it to be read as a book.
Historia Plantarum was first translated into Latin by Theodore Gaza; the translation was published in 1483. Johannes Bodaeus published a frequently cited folio edition in Amsterdam in 1644, complete with commentaries and woodcut illustrations. The first English translation was made by Sir Arthur Hort and published in 1916. (Wikipedia)</English>

Vesalius' "hands-on" magnum opus presents a careful examination of the organs and the complete structure of the human body.

As of 1750, the full title was Encyclop&#233;die, ou Dictionnaire raisonn&#233; des sciences, des arts et des m&#233;tiers, par une soci&#233;t&#233; de gens de lettres, mis en ordre par M. Diderot de l'Acad&#233;mie des Sciences et Belles-Lettres de Prusse, et quant &#224; la partie math&#233;matique, par M. d'Alembert de l'Acad&#233;mie royale des Sciences de Paris, de celle de Prusse et de la Soci&#233;t&#233; royale de Londres. ("Encyclopedia: or a Systematic Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts, and Crafts, by a Company of Men of Letters, arranged by M. Diderot of the Academy of Sciences and Belles-lettres of Prussia: as to the Mathematical Portion, arranged by M. d'Alembert of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Paris, to the Academy of Sciences in Prussia and to the Royal Society of London.") The title page was amended as D'Alembert acquired more titles.
The Encyclop&#233;die was an innovative encyclopedia in several respects. Among other things, it was the first encyclopedia to include contributions from many named contributors, and it was the first general encyclopedia to lavish attention on the mechanical arts. Still, the Encyclop&#233;die is famous above all for representing the thought of the Enlightenment. According to Denis Diderot in the article "Encyclop&#233;die", the Encyclop&#233;die's aim was "to change the way people think". He wanted to incorporate all of the world's knowledge into the Encyclop&#233;die and hoped that the text could disseminate all this information to the public and future generations.

		<English>[TAB] A difference engine is an automatic mechanical calculator designed to tabulate polynomial functions. The name derives from the method of divided differences, a way to interpolate or tabulate functions by using a small set of polynomial coefficients. Both logarithmic and trigonometric functions, functions commonly used by both navigators and scientists, can be approximated by polynomials, so a difference engine can compute many useful sets of numbers.
The historical difficulty in producing error-free tables by teams of mathematicians and human "computers" spurred Charles Babbage's desire to build a mechanism to automate the process. (Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of the chemical elements, organized on the basis of their atomic numbers (numbers of protons in the nucleus), electron configurations, and recurring chemical properties. Elements are presented in order of increasing atomic number, which is typically listed with the chemical symbol in each box. The standard form of the table consists of a grid of elements laid out in 18 columns and 7 rows, with a double row of elements below that. The table can also be deconstructed into four rectangular blocks: the s-block to the left, the p-block to the right, the d-block in the middle, and the f-block below that.
Although precursors exist, Dmitri Mendeleev is generally credited with the publication, in 1869, of the first widely recognized periodic table. He developed his table to illustrate periodic trends in the properties of the then-known elements. Mendeleev also predicted some properties of then-unknown elements that would be expected to fill gaps in this table. Most of his predictions were proved correct when the elements in question were subsequently discovered. Mendeleev's periodic table has since been expanded and refined with the discovery or synthesis of further new elements and the development of new theoretical models to explain chemical behavior.

For the sixth edition of 1872, the short title was changed to The Origin of Species. Darwin's book introduced the scientific theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection. It presented a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent through a branching pattern of evolution. Darwin included evidence that he had gathered on the Beagle expedition in the 1830s and his subsequent findings from research, correspondence, and experimentation.		(Wikipedia)</English>

Widely read by academics and laymen alike, it applied the ancient Greek view of the orderliness of the cosmos (the universe) to the Earth, suggesting that universal laws applied as well to the apparent chaos of the terrestrial world. In the first part of Kosmos, Humboldt paints a general "portrait of nature", describing the physical nature of outer space and the earth.

Then, around 1830, the Hungarian mathematician J&#225;nos Bolyai and the Russian mathematician Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky separately published treatises on hyperbolic geometry. Consequently, hyperbolic geometry is called Bolyai-Lobachevskian geometry, as both mathematicians, independent of each other, are the basic authors of non-Euclidean geometry.	(Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] The germ theory of disease states that some diseases are caused by microorganisms. These small organisms, too small to see without magnification, invade humans, animals, and other living hosts. Their growth and reproduction within their hosts can cause a disease. "Germ" may refer to not just a bacterium, but also a protist, fungus, virus, prion, or viroid. Microorganisms that cause disease are called pathogens, and the diseases they cause are called infectious diseases. Even when a pathogen is the principal cause of a disease, environmental and hereditary factors often influence the severity of the disease, and whether a particular host individual becomes infected when exposed to the pathogen.
The germ theory was proposed in the mid-16th century and gained widespread credence when substantiated by scientific discoveries of the 17th through the late 19th century. It supplanted earlier explanations for disease, such as Galen's miasma theory. (Wikipedia)</English>

A picture, a drawing or a coloured and even more artistic image is an extremely efficient tool in the hands of the anatomists, sometimes even more useful than the scalpel itself. And that happens because an image is the only way to lively represent the inner morphology of the human body even to whom has never attended a real dissection. The first full-scale illustrated anatomy book was written by Giacomo Berengario da Carpi. Berengario_s dead bodies are portrayed as protagonists of the moods and morals, a fact that can be perfectly understood in one of his most famous illustrations that depicts a muscle-man in the pose of an Apollo surrounded by an aureole of light. At the 
same time, Leonardo da Vinci was studying the function of the human body in his attempt to perfectly depict the human figure. His earliest pictures were based on the outer morphology of the human body, the skeleton and the body of animals, whereas his more recent pictures were based on the direct observation of the dissected human body. In his work da Vinci included a large number of anatomical subjects, such as bones, muscles and organic systems. ("The History and the Art of Anatomy", Alexandra Mavrodi et al., 2013) </English>

		<English>[TAB] The concept of infection was unknown until relatively modern times. The first progress in combating infection was made in 1847 by the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who noticed that medical students fresh from the dissecting room were causing excess maternal death compared to midwives. Semmelweis, despite ridicule and opposition, introduced compulsory handwashing for everyone entering the maternal wards and was rewarded with a plunge in maternal and fetal deaths, however the Royal Society dismissed his advice.
		Lister continued to develop improved methods of antisepsis and asepsis when he realised that infection could be better avoided by preventing bacteria from getting into wounds in the first place. This led to the rise of sterile surgery. Lister introduced the Steam Steriliser to sterilize equipment, instituted rigorous hand washing and later implemented the wearing of rubber gloves. His discoveries paved the way for a dramatic expansion to the capabilities of the surgeon; for his contributions he is often regarded as the father of modern surgery. These three crucial advances - the adoption of a scientific methodology toward surgical operations, the use of anaesthetic and the introduction of sterilised equipment - laid the groundwork for the modern invasive surgical techniques of today.

A patient under the effects of anesthesia is said to be anesthetized. Modern pain control through anesthesia was discovered in the mid-19th century. Before the advent of anesthesia, surgery was a traumatically painful procedure and surgeons were encouraged to be as swift as possible to minimize patient suffering. This also meant that operations were largely restricted to amputations and external growth removals. Beginning in the 1840s, surgery began to change dramatically in character with the discovery of effective and practical anaesthetic chemicals such as ether, first used by the American surgeon Crawford Long, and chloroform, discovered by James Young Simpson and later pioneered by John Snow, physician to Queen Victoria. In addition to relieving patient suffering, anaesthesia allowed more intricate operations in the internal regions of the human body. In addition, the discovery of muscle relaxants such as curare allowed for safer applications. (Wikipedia)</English>

Vaccination, the term which soon replaced cowpox inoculation and vaccine inoculation, was first used in print by Jenner's friend, Richard Dunning in 1800.

An oral vaccine was developed by Albert Sabin using attenuated poliovirus. Human trials of Sabin's vaccine began in 1957, and it was licensed in 1962. There is no long term carrier state for poliovirus in immunocompetent individuals, polioviruses have no non-primate reservoir in nature (although they have been induced in transgenic mice), and survival of the virus in the environment for an extended period of time appears to be remote. Therefore, interruption of person to person transmission of the virus by vaccination is the critical step in global polio eradication.

		<English>[TAB] There are considerable overlaps between the terms clothing-/garment-, textile- and fashion industry. The clothing sector is concerned with all types of clothes, from fashion to uniforms, e-textiles and workwear. Textile industry is less concerned with the fashion aspect but produces the fabrics and fibres that are required for tailoring. The fashion industry closely follows - and sets - fashion trends to always supply the latest in non-functional clothing. By the early 20th century, the industry in the developed world often involved immigrants in "sweat shops", which were usually legal but were sometimes illegally operated. They employed people in crowded conditions, working manual sewing machines, and being paid less than a living wage. This trend worsened due to attempts to protect existing industries which were being challenged by developing countries in South East Asia, the Indian subcontinent and Central America. Although globalization saw the manufacturing largely outsourced to overseas labor markets, there has been a trend for the areas historically associated with the trade to shift focus to the more white collar associated industries of fashion design, fashion modeling and retail. Areas historically involved heavily in the "rag trade" include London and Milan in Europe, and the SoHo district in New York City. (Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] In 1856, whilst trying to synthesise quinine, von Hofmann's student William Henry Perkin discovered mauveine and went into industry producing the first synthetic dye. Other aniline dyes followed, such as fuchsine, safranine, and induline. At the time of mauveine's discovery, aniline was expensive. Soon thereafter, applying a method reported in 1854 by Antoine Béchamp, it was prepared "by the ton". The Béchamp reduction enabled the evolution of a massive dye industry in Germany. Today, the name of BASF, originally Badische Anilin- und Soda-Fabrik (English: Baden Aniline and Soda Factory), now among the largest chemical suppliers, echoes the legacy of the synthetic dye industry, built via aniline dyes and extended via the related azo dyes. The first azo dye was aniline yellow. (Wikipedia)</English>

		<German>[TAB] A riot is a form of civil disorder commonly characterized by a group lashing out in a violent public disturbance against authority, property or people. Riots typically involve theft, vandalism, and destruction of property, public or private. The property targeted varies depending on the riot and the inclinations of those involved. Targets can include shops, cars, restaurants, state-owned institutions, and religious buildings.

		<English>[TAB] A fazenda is a plantation found throughout Brazil; during the colonial period (16th - 18th centuries) they were concentrated primarily in the northeastern region, where (sugar) was produced, expanding during the 19th century in the southeastern region to coffee production. Fazenda now denotes any kind of farm.
Fazendas created major export commodities for Brazilian trade, but also led to intensification of slavery in Brazil. Coffee provided a new basis for agricultural expansion in southern Brazil. In the provinces of Rio de Janeiro and then S&#227;o Paulo, coffee estates, or fazendas, began to spread toward the interior as new lands were opened. By 1850, coffee made up more than 50% of Brazil's exports, and more than half of world coffee production.
Along with the expansion of coffee growing came an intensification of slavery in Brazil, as the country's primary form of labor. More than 1.4 million Africans were forced to be slaves in Brazil in the last 50 years of the slave trade, and even after the trans-Atlantic slave trade ended, slavery continued until 1888.
Because of the increased profit from the trade of coffee, the years after 1850 saw considerable growth and prosperity in Brazil. Railroads, steamships and the telegraph were introduced to Brazil, all paid for by the money the fazendas supplied from their coffee crop. In growing cities such as Rio de Janeiro and S&#227;o Paulo, merchants, lawyers, a middle class, and an urban working class grew, once again paid for by the money coming from the fazendas.

For most of Russian history, uyezds were a secondary-level of administrative division. By sense, but not by etymology, uyezd approximately corresponds to the English term county. Originally describing groups of several volosts, they formed around the most important cities.

		<English>[TAB] Mit'a was mandatory public service in the society of the Inca Empire. Its close relative, the regionally mandatory Minka is still in use in Quechua communities today and known as faena in Spanish. Mit'a was used for the construction of roads, bridges, agricultural terraces, and fortifications in ancient Peru. Mit'a was effectively a form of tribute to the Inca government in the form of labor. In the Incan Empire, public service was required in community-driven projects such as the building of their extensive road network. Military service was also mandatory.
[PARAGRAPH:2]All citizens who could perform labor were required to do so for a set number of days out of a year (the basic meaning of the word mit'a is a regular turn or a season). The Inca Empire's wealth would cause a family often to require only sixty-five days to farm; the rest of the year was devoted entirely to the mit'a. A relative of the Mit'a (federal work) is the modern Quechua system of Mink'a (communal work) or faena, which is mostly applied at small-scale villages. The Mink'a was adopted during the 1960s on large-scale federal projects of Peru. [PARAGRAPH](Wikipedia)</English>

Military motives prompted the Ethiopian elite to change their capitals from fixed to mobile settlements. Ethiopian wandering capitals possessed many of the characteristics that are often used to distinguish cities from other forms of settlement. Roving capitals were large and densely populated enough to qualify for city status, they performed an essentially urban role of administration, the capitals were heterogeneous socially, and representatives of the Ethiopian literati were present. The population of these capitals were for the most part only seasonally urban and seasonally rural. And yet, these capitals were not permanent.</English>

		<English>[TAB] A foundry is a factory that produces metal castings. Metals are cast into shapes by melting them into a liquid, pouring the metal into a mold, and removing the mold material after the metal has solidified as it cools. The most common metals processed are aluminum and cast iron. However, other metals, such as bronze, brass, steel, magnesium, and zinc, are also used to produce castings in foundries. In this process, parts of desired shapes and sizes can be formed.
[TAB] Foundries are one of the largest contributors to the manufacturing recycling movement, melting and recasting millions of tons of scrap metal every year to create new durable goods. Moreover, many foundries use sand in their molding process. These foundries often use, recondition, and reuse sand, which is another form of recycling.</English>

		<English>At the height of its power, the Mali Empire had a trading empire that stretched across Africa and into Europe, the Middle East, and Asia; the great wealth of the Mali Empire in large came from the rich gold mines of Bumbuk and Bure. [PARAGRAPH:2]Once the gold was extracted from the mine and purified, it needed to be shaped into a size and form that was easy for the Malinese to transport and to trade. Gold could be formed into large blocks or bars, but these were extremely heavy and cumbersome, and quite awkward to transport on horse/camelback. They were also so expensive that only governments and the very rich would be able to afford them, and so that form was usually reserved for large quantities of gold that were to be transported by ship. For smaller and more convenient uses, gold was formed into coins. [PARAGRAPH:2]A place where money is created is called a "mint." At a mint, the gold is melted and poured into a standardized coin form - or, in earlier times, it might be manually pounded and cut into shape. The coin is usually decorated with the ruler's head or some other recognizable symbol. The value of the gold coin is dependent upon the purity of the metal in the coin, and its weight. Throughout history the unscrupulous have attempted to pass off light or impure coins to unsuspecting purchasers. If widespread, this practice can seriously damage trade and cripple a nation's entire economy. To maintain a reputation for honest dealing, the Malinese needed to use fairly sophisticated measuring tools to ensure that their coins maintained a consistent value. This in turn spurred advancements in science and technology. [PARAGRAPH:2]The next great unit of exchange in the Mali Empire was salt. Salt was as valuable, if not more valuable, than gold in sub-Saharan Africa. It was cut into pieces and spent on goods with close to equal buying power throughout the empire. While it was as good as gold in the north, it was even better in the south. The people of the south needed salt for their diet, but it was extremely rare.[citation needed] The northern region on the other hand had no shortage of salt. Every year merchants entered Mali via Oualata with camel loads of salt to sell in Niani. According to Ibn Battuta who visited Mali in the mid-14th century, one camel load of salt sold at Walata for 8-10 mithqals of gold, but in Mali proper it realised 20-30 ducats and sometimes even 40. One particular source of salt in the Mali Empire was salt-mining sites located in Taghaza. Ibn Battuta had written that in Taghaza there were no trees and there is only sand and the salt mines. Nobody lived in the area except the Musafa servants who worked to dig the salts and lived on dates imported from Sijilmasa and the Dar'a valley, camel meat and millet imported from the Sudan. The buildings were constructed from slabs of salt and roofed with camel skins. The salt was dug from the ground and cut into thick slabs, two of which were loaded onto each camel where they would be taken south across the desert to Oualata and sold. The value of the salt was chiefly determined by the transport costs. Ibn Battuta mentions that the value of salt increased fourfold when transported between Oualata and the Malian capital.[PARAGRAPH:2]</English>
		<German>In der Bl&#252;tezeit des Malinesischen Reiches erstreckten sich seine Handelsaktivit&#228;ten von Afrika &#252;ber Europa in den Mittleren Osten und sogar bis nach Asien. Seinen gro&#223;en Reichtum verdankt das Land dem Abbau seiner reichhaltigen Goldminen in Bumbuk und Bure. [PARAGRAPH:2]Nachdem das Gold gesch&#252;rft und gereinigt worden war, musste es in eine kompaktere Form gebracht werden, damit die Malinesen es leichter transportieren und besser verkaufen konnten. Es gab zwar die M&#246;glichkeit, das Gold in gro&#223;e Bl&#246;cke oder Barren zu formen, die jedoch sehr schwer und sperrig waren und f&#252;r den Transport zu Pferd bzw. Kamel eher ungeeignet. Au&#223;erdem waren sie so wertvoll, dass nur Regierungen und extrem reiche Einzelpersonen sie kaufen konnten, daher waren diese Varianten f&#252;r gro&#223;e Goldmengen reserviert, die mit dem Schiff transportiert wurden. F&#252;r kleinere Goldmengen, die sich besser handhaben lie&#223;en, wurde es in M&#252;nzen geformt. [PARAGRAPH:2]Geldst&#252;cke werden in einer M&#252;nzanstalt hergestellt. Hier wird das Gold eingeschmolzen und in eine vorgefertigte M&#252;nzform gegossen - fr&#252;her wurde es mitunter sogar von Hand behauen und in Form geschnitten. Die M&#252;nze zeigt normalerweise den Kopf des regierenden Herrschers oder ein anderes Symbol mit Wiedererkennungswert. Der Geldwert der Goldm&#252;nze h&#228;ngt von der Reinheit des verarbeiteten Metalls und seinem Gewicht ab. Im Laufe der Geschichte haben skrupellose Geldf&#228;lscher leider immer wieder versucht, arglosen K&#228;ufern leichtere, minderwertigere M&#252;nzen zu verkaufen. Eine gro&#223; angelegte Falschgeldverbreitung kann den Handel enorm beeintr&#228;chtigen und der gesamten Wirtschaft eines Landes erheblichen Schaden zuf&#252;gen. Um nicht in Verruf zu geraten und fairen Geldhandel betreiben zu k&#246;nnen, mussten die Malinesen relativ genaue Messger&#228;te benutzen, damit ihre M&#252;nzen tats&#228;chlich stets einen konstanten Wert aufwiesen. Diese Vorgehensweise f&#252;hrte letztlich auch zu weiteren Fortschritten in Wissenschaft und Technik. [PARAGRAPH:2]</German>

		<English>[TAB] The Arg-e Bam, located in the city of Bam, Kerman Province of southeastern Iran, is the largest adobe building in the world. The entire building was a large fortress containing the citadel, but because the citadel dominates the ruins, the entire fortress is now named Bam Citadel. 
[TAB] There is no precise archaeological dating of the buildings of the Citadel of Bam. During the Parthian rule, the fort was expanded and became Arg-e-Bam, the Citadel of Bam. A comparative study, titled "Bam and a Brief History of Urban Settlement and Planning in Iran", concluded that the essential core of the city of Bam and the Governor's section were built during the Parthian era. Under the Sassanids, the castle was seized by Ardeshir Babakan. New fortifications and walls were constructed between 224 and 637 AD.
[TAB] In 645 AD, the Kerman region was conquered by the Arabs and Arg-e-Bam probably suffered damage during the war. One of the Arab commanders established the Al Rasoul mosque, one of the first mosques built in Iran in the early Islamic era. In 656 AD, the Khawarij, a group of Muslims defeated by Ali, escaped to Kerman and Bam where they settled in the Arg-e-Bam. In 869 AD, Ya'qub ibn al-Layth al-Saffar who was fighting the Abbasids, defeated the Khawarij and took over Arg-e-Bam. It then became his permanent base camp. The name of Bam is mentioned for the first time by Islamic writers in the 10th century. According to these authors, Bam was then a well established market place surrounded by a wide agricultural area. The city was famous for its elegant and tasteful cotton fabrics, its supposedly impregnable fortress, its busy bazaars, and its palm trees.
[TAB] After the Mongol invasion of Iran, Bam and the Kerman region were turned over to the Qarakhataian dynasty, who ruled the region from 1240 to 1363 AD. Bam benefited from a strategic location on the spice route, connecting the region to the Silk Road. The city was renowned for silkworm breeding and a flourishing silk industry.
[TAB] On 26 December 2003, the citadel was almost completely destroyed by an earthquake, along with much of the rest of Bam and its environs. A few days after the earthquake, the President of Iran, Mohammad Khatami, announced that the citadel would be rebuilt. (Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] Before the beginning of the 20th century, the only means of obtaining pearls was by manually gathering very large numbers of pearl oysters or mussels from the ocean floor or lake or river bottom. The bivalves were then brought to the surface, opened, and the tissues searched. More than a ton were searched in order to find at least 3-4 quality beads. In order to find enough pearl oysters, free-divers were often forced to descend to depths of over 100 feet on a single breath, exposing them to the dangers of hostile creatures, waves, eye damage, and drowning, often as a result of shallow water blackout on resurfacing. Because of the difficulty of diving and the unpredictable nature of natural pearl growth in pearl oysters, pearls of the time were extremely rare and of varying quality. 
[TAB] Some pearl oysters are found on shoals at a depth of 5-7 feet (1.5-2.1 meters) from the surface, but more often divers had to go 40 feet (12 meters) or even up to 125 feet (38 meters) deep to find enough pearl oysters. Divers had only very basic forms of technology to aid their survival at such depths. For example, they greased their bodies to conserve heat, put greased cotton in their ears, wore a tortoise-shell clip to close their nostrils, gripped a large object like a rock to descend without the wasteful effort of swimming down, and had a wide-mouthed basket or net to hold the oysters.		
[TAB] Pearl divers near the Philippines were successful at harvesting large pearls, especially in the Sulu Archipelago. Pearls from the Sulu Archipelago were considered the "finest of the world" which were found in "high bred" shells in deep, clear, and rapid tidal waters. At times, the largest pearls belonged by law to the sultan, and selling them could result in the death penalty for the seller. The "Pearl of Lao Tzu" was once considered the largest known pearl. The pearl was found in the Palawan sea, which surrounds the island of Palawan in the Philippines, and was found by a Filipino diver. It measures 24 centimeters in diameter (9.45 inches) and weighs 6.4 kilograms (14.2 lb). (Wikipedia)</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_BUILDING_GLADIATOR_SCHOOL_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB] The earliest named gladiator school (singular: ludus; plural: ludi) is that of Aurelius Scaurus at Capua. He was lanista of the gladiators employed by the state circa 105 BC to instruct the legions and simultaneously entertain the public. Few other lanistae are known by name: they headed their familia gladiatoria, and had lawful power over life and death of every family member, including servi poenae, auctorati and ancillaries. Socially, they were infames, on a footing with pimps and butchers and despised as price gougers. No such stigma was attached to a gladiator owner (munerarius or editor) of good family, high status and independent means; Cicero congratulated his friend Atticus on buying a splendid troop-if he rented them out, he might recover their entire cost after two performances.
[TAB] For the poor, and for non-citizens, enrollment in a gladiator school offered a trade, regular food, housing of sorts and a fighting chance of fame and fortune. Mark Antony chose a troupe of gladiators to be his personal bodyguard. Gladiators customarily kept their prize money and any gifts they received, and these could be substantial. Tiberius offered several retired gladiators 100,000 sesterces each to return to the arena. Nero gave the gladiator Spiculus property and residence "equal to those of men who had celebrated triumphs."		
[TAB] The military were great aficionados of the games, and supervised the schools. Many schools and amphitheatres were sited at or near military barracks, and some provincial army units owned gladiator troupes. As the Republic wore on, the term of military service increased from ten to the sixteen years formalised by Augustus in the Principate. It would rise to twenty, and later, to twenty-five years. Roman military discipline was ferocious; severe enough to provoke mutiny, despite the consequences. A career as a volunteer gladiator may have seemed an attractive option for some.		
[TAB] In AD 69, the Year of the Four Emperors, Otho's troops at Bedriacum included 2000 gladiators. Opposite him on the field, Vitellius's army was swollen by levies of slaves, plebs and gladiators. In 167 AD, troop depletions by plague and desertion may have prompted Marcus Aurelius to draft gladiators at his own expense. During the Civil Wars that led to the Principate, Octavian (later Augustus) acquired the personal gladiator troop of his erstwhile opponent, Mark Antony. They had served their late master with exemplary loyalty but thereafter, they disappear from the record. (Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB] "Bread and circuses" (or bread and games; from Latin: panem et circenses) is a metonymic phrase referring to superficial appeasement. It is attributed to Juvenal (Satires, Satire X), a Roman poet active in the late first and early second century AD, and is used commonly in cultural, particularly political, contexts. Juvenal refers to the Roman practice of providing free wheat to Roman citizens as well as costly circus games and other forms of entertainment as a means of gaining political power.
[TAB] Ludi (Latin:games; plural of "ludus") were public games held for the benefit and entertainment of the Roman people (populus Romanus). Ludi were held in conjunction with, or sometimes as the major feature of, Roman religious festivals, and were also presented as part of the cult of state. As religious ceremonies, ludi were organized at first by various colleges of priests; during the Republic, they were later presented by consuls, but became most associated with the responsibilities of the aediles. Although public money was allocated for the staging of ludi, the presiding official increasingly came to augment the splendor of his games from personal funds as a form of public relations. The sponsor was able to advertise his wealth, while declaring that he intended to share it for public benefit. Although some men with an eye on the consulship skipped the office of aedile for the very reason that massive expenditures were expected, those with sufficient resources spent lavishly to cultivate the favor of the people. The religious festivals to which the ludi were attached also occasioned public banquets, and often public works such as the refurbishing or building of temples.		
[TAB] Cura Annonae ("care of Annona") was the import and distribution of grain to the residents of the cities of Rome and, after its foundation, Constantinople. The term was used in honour of the goddess Annona. The city of Rome imported all the grain consumed by its population, estimated to number 1,000,000 by the 2nd century AD. This included recipients of the grain dole or corn dole, a government program which gave out subsidized grain, then free grain, and later bread, to about 200,000 of Rome's adult male citizens. Rome's grain subsidies were originally ad hoc emergency measures taken to import cheap grain from trading partners and allies at times of scarcity, to help feed growing numbers of indebted and dispossessed citizen-farmers. By the end of the Republic, grain subsidies and doles had become permanent, uniquely Roman institutions. (Wikipedia)</English>
